You remove the top one, and study it; your finger slips across a square in one corner, and strange sentences start playing through your mind. You struggle to make sense of the unfamiliar words and concepts in your thoughts.)

Many #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[moon-craters]#{normal}##LAST# after he #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[planted]#{normal}##LAST# us and #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[retired]#{normal}##LAST#, the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# awoke from his #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[cocoon]#{normal}##LAST# to see us #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattling]#{normal}##LAST#. He was shocked at our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[wilted]#{normal}##LAST# state, asking us why we #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattled]#{normal}##LAST#; we told him about the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[shaking]#{normal}##LAST# we had to suffer through, the way the planet was #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[jammed up]#{normal}##LAST# and how although our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[peas in a pod]#{normal}##LAST# had #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[plugged the leaks]#{normal}##LAST# to keep the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# from #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[falling out]#{normal}##LAST#, the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[brooms]#{normal}##LAST# kept sweeping our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[dust bunnies]#{normal}##LAST# away, and there wasn't enough empty room to keep the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# from #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[cracking]#{normal}##LAST#.

(There is a larger square on the tablet here; you press your hand to it, and suddenly you see a desert planet, ravaged by constant dust-storms. You feel the futility of a short, greenish thing as he looks on his ruined crops; you feel the wrath of a red-skinned humanoid as he rushes at a large horde of small, onyx creatures, a sword in one hand and a fireball in the other. The images disappear as you remove your hand.)

#{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# gave us his #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tools]#{normal}##LAST#, and after we #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tripped the janitors?]#{normal}##LAST# he had us #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[shake gently?]#{normal}##LAST#, but instead of #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattling]#{normal}##LAST# we were #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[making music]#{normal}##LAST#, only #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[cracking]#{normal}##LAST# the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# that made us #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[out of tune]#{normal}##LAST#; our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# grew stronger, learned how to use #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tools]#{normal}##LAST# of different #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[colors]#{normal}##LAST# than what the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# gave us. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# loved to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[hear our music]#{normal}##LAST#, and we were grateful he was there to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[compose]#{normal}##LAST# for us when we needed; soon we were #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[writing our own music]#{normal}##LAST# and didn't need to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattle]#{normal}##LAST# anymore, and the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[retired]#{normal}##LAST#.

(Another larger square. You see a wonderful, loving #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# descending on the planet, desert turning to lush forest with his touch; you worship him with your green and onyx and ruby brethren, all different shapes and sizes, united for the first time in appreciating all the good he's done for you. For the first time in ages, you know where your next meal is coming from, and you need not fear others killing you for your farmland, nor the dust storms. He holds the corpses of some reclusive earth-mages in his hand, the source of the storms; you would be angry at them, but you can only feel happiness for the future to come. You and your brethren start competing in an organized fashion, occasionally in fights again, but even when you die you know it's for the good of the planet; an age later, you and your brethren are smarter, stronger, and far happier than before, living in paradise. You remove your hand an instant later, and the feelings of worship and admiration drain from you.)

Eventually, the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# came. We tried to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[crack their beads]#{normal}##LAST# but nothing happened; they did not try to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[crack]#{normal}##LAST# us but instead promised us even more wonderful #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[sheet music]#{normal}##LAST# than what our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# had given us, under the condition that we let them #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[shatter]#{normal}##LAST# him. We refused, but we reached a #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[nasty pod]#{normal}##LAST# together; we'd #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[mute? pot?]#{normal}##LAST# the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# with the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tools]#{normal}##LAST# he gave us, leaving him a #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[lazy carpenter]#{normal}##LAST# and proving our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[pod was shut]#{normal}##LAST# with the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST#.

The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# were pleased, and #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[smeared]#{normal}##LAST# their #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[eggsuckers]#{normal}##LAST# on our planet, letting us trade with #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[pods from other plants]#{normal}##LAST# from all other kinds of #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[gardens]#{normal}##LAST#. We tasted new food, learned new #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tools]#{normal}##LAST#, and some #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[fancy]#{normal}##LAST# types of new #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# came to our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[garden]#{normal}##LAST#. We felt a little #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[noise]#{normal}##LAST# about our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST#, but he was not #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[noisy]#{normal}##LAST# and wouldn't #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[hear]#{normal}##LAST# any #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[sounds]#{normal}##LAST#. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# acted as our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[pod peas]#{normal}##LAST#, and we treated them with great #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[listening]#{normal}##LAST#, even as they #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[slipped from the pod]#{normal}##LAST# and we could no longer #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[attend each other's concerts]#{normal}##LAST#.

(You touch the panel on the next page. A creature appears before you, stepping out of a massive fortress - it has an egg-shaped body, and limbs like four #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tendril-weeds]#{normal}##LAST#. You hate this thing with all your being, although you know you did not at the time. They say they want the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# dead, and can offer you great magic and technology in return; you loathe to consider the idea, but their fortresses and weapons make you wonder if their offer is truly optional. You consider waking #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# to ask him for help, but worry that even he could not stand up to the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST#; ultimately you decided to seal him in his sleep, leaving him harmless but unharmed, unconscious until further intervention. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# begrudgingly accept this resolution, and keep up their end of the bargain. They give you strange, powerful artifacts, and build portals on your world that let you pass through to strange worlds, more incredible and beautiful than you could possibly imagine, and filled with other races who've been given these gifts and seek to trade. You taste new foods, learn new magic, hear new music, and discover more beauty than you have in your entire history. If not for the pangs of guilt, life could not be better. Only when you remove your hand and the images start clearing from your mind do you recognize the "egg-weeds" as the Sher'Tul.)

Then, there was great #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[noise]#{normal}##LAST#. It got #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[louder]#{normal}##LAST#. It got #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[louder]#{normal}##LAST#.

(There is another panel. You dare not touch it, but as you reach to put it away, a finger briefly brushes across it. Starvation, burning, suffocation, misery, fury, and sheer agony rage across your mind for what you know to be a tenth of a second, but feels like half a minute. Your ears are still ringing as you move on to the next square.)

The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[eggsuckers]#{normal}##LAST# were a trap, a #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[discord]#{normal}##LAST# planted by the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[crack]#{normal}##LAST# us all, and only cause #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[hairline fracture]#{normal}##LAST# to their own #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[garden]#{normal}##LAST#. Their #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[wrong note]#{normal}##LAST# turned our planet to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[cacophony]#{normal}##LAST#, and nearly all of us #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[fell out of the pod]#{normal}##LAST#. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[apple was peeled]#{normal}##LAST# and a fragment of our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[shell]#{normal}##LAST# floated in the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[ocean]#{normal}##LAST#. Our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[handymen]#{normal}##LAST# acted quickly to give the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[peel]#{normal}##LAST# and our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[garden]#{normal}##LAST# #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tempo]#{normal}##LAST#, and would have failed had the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[noise]#{normal}##LAST# not woken up #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST#.

We were sorry. We were so sorry. Our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[pod]#{normal}##LAST# was #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rotten]#{normal}##LAST# and we knew it; we should never have #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[planted it]#{normal}##LAST#. Father forgave us for our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[spoiled barrel]#{normal}##LAST# and #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[fertilized our garden]#{normal}##LAST#; it was still burning and #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[salted]#{normal}##LAST#, but by #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[breaking out the toolbox]#{normal}##LAST# we could still #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[plant seeds]#{normal}##LAST# on it. We could not #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[bloom]#{normal}##LAST# but we could #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[hold a note, just one note]#{normal}##LAST#. #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# is still devoting all his will to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[nailing our garden together]#{normal}##LAST#; it will #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[splinter and wilt]#{normal}##LAST# if he stopped for even a second. Bless the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# in his altruism. Bless the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST#. We are so sorry.

(You unsteadily touch your palm to the next panel. You stand on a charred, bubbling cliff, and see a black, star-dotted expanse above and below you. Your feet are constantly searing; the mages could give you oxygen and convert ambient magic into caloric energy, but they couldn't undo the terrible magical flames that rage on the blown-off continent, or the eternal pyre of your former planet. Nearly everyone you know is dead, and your scryers tell you the home of the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# has suffered only minor damage; all the others you've contacted through portals were blown apart instantly. Your home only survives from the constant effort and concentration of #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST#, who is exerting every bit of magic he can to keep the shattered fragments from spinning off into the void. There is no part of you that does not feel deep regret; you would commit suicide if you did not hope there was a way you could apologize to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST#, work as tirelessly and selflessly as he is. The regret drains as your hand leaves the panel.)

We asked #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# what #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[song to sing]#{normal}##LAST# to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[make him dance]#{normal}##LAST# again. He told us: #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattle]#{normal}##LAST# the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# until their every last #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[bead falls out]#{normal}##LAST#. We know our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[orchestra hall]#{normal}##LAST#, and we will #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[crash the party]#{normal}##LAST#. For our sake, giving us a new #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[garden]#{normal}##LAST# to replace the one the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# or their #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[sprouts]#{normal}##LAST# stole from us. For #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST#'s sake, to let him #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[retire]#{normal}##LAST# again once we're #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[planted]#{normal}##LAST# once more. For everyone's sake, to avenge the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[spilled beads]#{normal}##LAST# from the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[brushfire]#{normal}##LAST# and bring #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[silence]#{normal}##LAST# from the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# and any #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[weeds]#{normal}##LAST# they #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[planted]#{normal}##LAST#.

(There is another panel. You touch it briefly. You hate yourself. You hate Eyal. You hate the Sher'Tul. You hate anything and everything around you. You want to destroy it, letting the souls of trillions know that justice has been done. You want to purge not just the Sher'Tul, but anything that has ever been close to them. Elves. Halflings. Orcs. Humans. All could carry their taint. All survived, while everything else that used a portal burned. If there is even a possibility that a single Sher'Tul remains on Eyal, it must be purged in blighted fire. Justice has to be done to Eyal. You remain angry at nothing in particular for ten minutes after you remove your hand.)

#{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# helped our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[carpenters]#{normal}##LAST# make #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[power tools]#{normal}##LAST#, forms of his blessed #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[fix-it wrenches]#{normal}##LAST# which could transform us to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[shake harder]#{normal}##LAST#. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[peas]#{normal}##LAST# dripped with acid, the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beets]#{normal}##LAST# gained tremendous speed, the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[peppers]#{normal}##LAST# fused their hands with #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[noisy dirt]#{normal}##LAST# to sling it at those who originally #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[made the racket]#{normal}##LAST#. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[blooming]#{normal}##LAST# is a little #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[noisy]#{normal}##LAST#, but nothing compared to the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds' screech]#{normal}##LAST#. We will either #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[be a handyman]#{normal}##LAST# or #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[wilt in the sun]#{normal}##LAST#. Press the next panel to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[grab a toolbox]#{normal}##LAST#. Be a #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[handyman]#{normal}##LAST#.

(You know all too well what this next panel does, and memories of being chained and bound while a wretchling presses it to your forehead flash through your mind. Despite a fading compulsion, no force in Eyal could convince you to touch the panel.)
]], [[	你看到一堆奇怪的石板，整齐地放在一个架子上。你从架子上拿起第一块石板，试着读懂上面的信息。当你的手指触及石板的瞬间，一些奇怪的语句在你的头脑中涌动。你竭尽全力，努力理解那些奇怪的词语和图画。

在他#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [播种] #{normal}##LAST#我们并陷入#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [沉睡] #{normal}##LAST#后已经经过了许多#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [环形山] #{normal}##LAST#，#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [父亲] #{normal}##LAST#大人终于从他的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [茧] #{normal}##LAST#里醒来，看到我们正在 #{italic}##FIREBRICK# [互相争斗] #{normal}##LAST#。他惊异于我们#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [枯槁] #{normal}##LAST# 的样子，问我们为什么要#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [互相争斗] #{normal}##LAST#；我们告诉他我们所经历的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [摇动] #{normal}##LAST#，这个星球已经被#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [毁坏] #{normal}##LAST#。无论我们的 #{italic}##FIREBRICK# [豆荚里的豆子] #{normal}##LAST#如何努力#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [填补裂缝] #{normal}##LAST#以防止#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [珠子] #{normal}##LAST##{italic}##FIREBRICK# [落下] #{normal}##LAST#，那些#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [扫帚] #{normal}##LAST#仍然将我们的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [尘土兔子] #{normal}##LAST#清理干净。我们没有足够的土地来防止#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [珠子] #{normal}##LAST#被#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [打碎] #{normal}##LAST#。

（石板上有一个巨大的方块；当你把手按在上面的时候，你突然看到了一片荒芜的星球，尘土飓风不时在星球上横扫蹂躏。你可以感受到一个绿色的小生物望着自己被毁坏的庄稼时绝望的心情；一旁红色皮肤的生物愤怒地冲向一大群小型的缟玛瑙色的生物，他们一手拿着长剑，一手操纵火球。当你把手放开时，那些影像消失了。）

#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [父亲] #{normal}##LAST#给了我们他的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [工具] #{normal}##LAST#，在我们#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [解开束缚？] #{normal}##LAST#后，他让我们#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [有礼貌地摇动] #{normal}##LAST#我们。我们不再#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [互相争斗] #{normal}##LAST#而是#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [创作音乐] #{normal}##LAST#，只#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [打碎] #{normal}##LAST#那些使我们#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [走调] #{normal}##LAST#的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [珠子] #{normal}##LAST#。我们的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [珠子] #{normal}##LAST#变得越来越强，学会了使用#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [父亲] #{normal}##LAST#给我们的各种#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [颜色] #{normal}##LAST#的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [工具] #{normal}##LAST#。#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [父亲] #{normal}##LAST#喜欢#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [听我们的音乐] #{normal}##LAST#，我们也为他能为我们#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [谱曲] #{normal}##LAST#感到高兴；不久我们学会了#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [创造自己的音乐] #{normal}##LAST#，我们不再#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [互相争斗] #{normal}##LAST#，#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [父亲] #{normal}##LAST#也再一次地#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [沉睡] #{normal}##LAST#。

（这上面也有一个巨大的方块。你看到和蔼可亲的伟大父亲降临星球，他的手触及之处，沙漠变成了茂密的森林；你和你红宝石色、绿翡翠色和缟玛瑙色的同胞都对它无限崇拜。所有同胞，无论体格大小，无论身体形态，都团聚在一起，感激父亲大人为我们所做的贡献。多年以来，你终于结束了居无定所食不果腹的生活，再也不会有其他人或是尘土风暴摧残你的农田了。他手中握着一些邪恶的法师的尸体，他们是尘土风暴的罪魁祸首；你对他们恨之入骨，但你知道，未来幸福的时代终将到来。你和你的同族开始有组织地相互竞赛起来，有时也会有战斗，但即使你在赛场上战死你也知道你正为这颗星球做出贡献。多年以后，你和你的同族变得更聪明、更强壮，你们过得生活比以前更加幸福，宛如在天堂一般。你把手从石板上移开，满溢胸中的崇拜和赞美之情突然消失了。）

然而，一群#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [鸡蛋怪] #{normal}##LAST#出现了。我们试着#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [打碎他们的珠子] #{normal}##LAST#，但是失败了；他们并不准备#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [打碎] #{normal}##LAST#我们，而是承诺给我们比我们#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [父亲] #{normal}##LAST#给我们的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [音乐集] #{normal}##LAST#更好的东西，不过有一个条件：我们必须#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [打碎] #{normal}##LAST##{italic}##FIREBRICK# [父亲] #{normal}##LAST#。我们拒绝了，但是我们最终达成了一个#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [糟糕的豆子] #{normal}##LAST#：我们使用他亲手给我们的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [工具] #{normal}##LAST##{italic}##FIREBRICK# [沉默？栽种？] #{normal}##LAST#了伟大的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [父亲] #{normal}##LAST#，让他成为了一个#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [懒惰的木匠] #{normal}##LAST#，以向#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [鸡蛋怪] #{normal}##LAST#证明我们的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [豆荚已经不在了] #{normal}##LAST#。#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [父亲] #{normal}##LAST#不会被这样的过程#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [烦扰或打碎] #{normal}##LAST#，他根本不知道发生了什么。这些#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [鸡蛋怪] #{normal}##LAST#为我们的行为感到高兴，在我们的星球上#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [放置] #{normal}##LAST#了#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [鸡蛋吸盘] #{normal}##LAST#，让我们可以和其他各种#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [花园] #{normal}##LAST#之间交易#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [其他植物的豆荚] #{normal}##LAST#。我们尝到了新的食物，学习了新的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [工具] #{normal}##LAST#，并领略了各种各样#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [有趣] #{normal}##LAST#的，来到我们#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [花园] #{normal}##LAST#的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [珠子] #{normal}##LAST#。我们似乎听到了来自#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [父亲] #{normal}##LAST#的一些#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [声音] #{normal}##LAST#，但是他的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [声音并不大] #{normal}##LAST#，并且他#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [听不到] #{normal}##LAST#外面的#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [声音] #{normal}##LAST#。#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [鸡蛋怪] #{normal}##LAST#成为了我们#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [豆荚里的豆子] #{normal}##LAST#，我们专心#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [聆听] #{normal}##LAST#他的声音，直到他们#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [从豆荚中滑落] #{normal}##LAST#，我们再也无法#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [参加他们的音乐会] #{normal}##LAST#。

（你的手轻放在了下一块石板上。眼前浮现了一个奇怪的生物，正从浮动的城堡中走出来——它有和蛋一样的身体，四肢则是如同海带一般的触手。你和你的所有同族都痛恨这个生物，但在当时你还并不知道一切。他们说他们希望干掉#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [父亲] #{normal}##LAST#，然后可以提供给你们强大的魔法和技术作为回报。你对这个提议深表厌恶，但是他们强大的堡垒和武器对你的恫吓迫使你不得不考虑这问题。你想要叫醒#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [父亲] #{normal}##LAST#大人寻求帮助，但又担心他可能无法击败那些#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [鸡蛋怪] #{normal}##LAST#。最终，你决定把他封印在沉睡之中。他虽然没有受伤，却也无法做出任何行动，直到进一步的介入为之都会保持着无意识的状态。那些#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [鸡蛋怪] #{normal}##LAST#勉强答应遵守了他们的诺言。他们带来了奇怪而强大的神器，在我们的世界建设起一座座传送门，让我们可以踏入走进那些未知的世界。外面的世界比任何人的想象都要壮丽和美好，到处是同样收到了来自他们礼物的人，想要和我们进行友好的贸易。你品尝了新的食物，学习了新的魔法，探索到了在你的漫长历史中不曾领略的壮丽美景。如果不是你的心中始终怀着愧疚之意，那这是你所领略过的最美好的生活。当你把手从石板上移开时，你的慢慢变得清晰的意识认出了那些“鸡蛋怪”就是夏·图尔人。）

然而，一阵#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [噪音] #{normal}##LAST#突然传来。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。传来的声音#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [越来越大] #{normal}##LAST#。#{italic}##FIREBRICK# [巨响传来] #{normal}##LAST#， 天崩地裂。

（你并不敢触摸另一块石板，然而在你试图把他移开的手指轻触之间，一阵强烈的痛苦瞬间掠过撕裂你的脑海。饥饿、灼烧、痛苦、折磨、狂怒，还有在你心头徘徊的直抒胸臆的苦闷和怒火。你的手指仅仅触及了石板一瞬间，然而你感受到的痛苦和折磨却宛如持续了数千年。在你把手伸向下一块石板之前，耳间仍然回响着之前的恐怖声音。）

t([[First, we were created by our Father, Urh'Rok. Then, many years later, we were in the desert, struggling and fighting each other for the few meager scraps of usable farmland. We do not know anything between these times; our cities, our culture, everything was wiped out by the dust storms. The storms hated us, toyed with us, subsided just long enough for us to raise armies and fight, then raged again the moment peace came. They wanted us to fight. They wanted us to struggle, suffer, die, leaving a few survivors to repopulate, and repeat the process. Green, onyx, red, all brothers who should have been allies, we fought at first because we had to, then because we could, then because we knew it was the only thing that kept the storms entertained.

Eventually, Urh'Rok appeared and told us he had been sealed away, prevented from helping us by people who had been creating the dust storms. Their cities lay hidden among us, shrouded in powerful magic to remain invisible. With a touch, he wiped the storms clean and turned the desert into lush jungle, filled with food. The storms appeared again, weaker this time; Urh'Rok grew furious and shattered the glass cities, reaching into one and pulling out a fistful of sadistic mages. He fed them to us - it was the best, largest feast any of us had eaten in millennia, and it was truly delicious. He did this to all the dust-mages' cities, then declared that we would never have to fear the storms again. We celebrated and worshiped our returned god - thanks to him, we knew where our next meal was coming from, and we had no reason to fight. All of us brethren dropped our weapons and hugged, forgiving each other for the assaults we knew we'd only done from fear. We loved each other, and we loved our god.

Our father began to fret, however. We were supposed to have grown more as species; our squabbling in the desert had stunted our growth, left us behind the curve. He set up a series of competitions and tournaments in all fields of life - magic, combat, negotiation - on a planetary scale. We were used to fighting by now, and now that we knew it was actually accomplishing something, now that we were pleasing an altruistic god, we did not mind it one bit. Those who died did so with smiles on their faces, knowing they'd contributed another data-point to our Father's plan. The weaker members of our many species willingly died off, and we all grew stronger, smarter, and happier as a result. Soon, we were grown enough to organize our own tournaments, and apply the findings to our societies and species; Father said he was pleased with us, and wanted us to determine our own destiny while he slept, recovering from all the work he'd just done. We continued our process of self-improvement - we wanted Father to be proud of us when he woke up.

Then, the Sher'Tul came.
]], [[起初，我们由我们的父亲乌鲁洛克所创造。在之后的许多年里，我们都长期居住在无尽的荒漠之中，为少数几片可怜的能用于耕作的土地而争斗不休。我们不知道任何有关那个时代的事情：我们的城市、我们的文化，所有的这些都被咆哮的尘土风暴卷走了。那些风暴厌恶我们，乃至戏弄我们，它们只有在我们组织军队战斗的时候才有短暂的停歇，一旦和平降临，咆哮而至的风暴瞬间就卷走了一切。他们想要我们不停争斗，他们想要我们挣扎，受苦，死亡，只留下少数的幸存者来保存种群。等到我们从废墟中重新发展起来，一切依旧。绿翡翠、缟玛瑙、红宝石，我们所有的兄弟起初都是盟友，然而我们一开始为了生存被迫各自为战，后来我们只能战斗，再到后来，我们的神经已经麻木，战争成了连续不断的风暴间唯一的娱乐活动。

最终，乌鲁洛克在我们的面前重现了，他告诉我们，因为他被长期封印，他不能帮助我们对抗那些制造尘土风暴的罪魁祸首。那些人使用强力的魔法隐藏他们的城市，阴毒地对我们偷偷发动袭击。乌鲁洛克只轻轻一触，风暴立刻被消散殆尽，荒芜的沙漠瞬间变成了充满富足食物的茂密森林。风暴再一次伺机对我们发动偷袭，然而这一次要弱得许多。乌鲁洛克异常愤怒，击碎了那些玻璃城市，将手伸入，抓起一把那些恶毒的法师。他把这些法师当作给我们的食物——啊，那真是千年以来我们所享用过的最大、最丰盛的盛筵。他这样清除了所有尘埃法师的据点，并向我们宣告——我们再也不用畏惧那些尘土分饱了。我们庆祝着我们伟大的神的归来——多亏了他，我们再也不会过那些居无定所，食不果腹的生活，也再也不需要互相争斗了。我们的同袍纷纷扔下武器互相拥抱，互相原谅了我们过去因为恐惧而产生的敌对之情。我们互相友爱，而我们更爱我们伟大的神。

然而，我们的父亲有些担心。我们本应该更加茁壮地成长，然而长期在荒漠中的互相争斗阻碍了我们的发展，让我们落后了。他设置了一系列有关生活各个方面的锦标赛——魔法、战斗、辩论——在全球范围内举行。我们曾经习惯于战斗，然而我们现在终于有了战斗的目标。为了让我们无私的神感到高兴，我们什么都愿意做。即使是在比赛中阵亡的人临死前也怀着满意的笑容，因为他的牺牲为父亲和整个种族的发展做出了贡献。我们的种族中那些弱小的个体们慢慢逝去，而我们变得更加强壮、更加聪明、也更加快乐。最终，我们成长到足够举办我们自己的锦标赛，并把比赛中得出的研究成果应用到我们生活中的方方面面：父亲为我们的行为感到高兴，想要让我们在他睡着时自己决定自己的命运，通过他给我们的礼物慢慢使我们的种群从长期的灾难中恢复起来。我们继续着这个自我完善的过程——我们希望父亲醒来之后能够以我们为荣。

此时，夏·图尔人出现了。

t([[They arrived in enormous flying fortresses, bristling with weapons and overflowing with magic. They did not directly threaten us, but they met with our leaders and gave us what was either an offer or an ultimatum: let them kill our Father, or kill him ourselves, and be rewarded with technology and magic as grand as theirs.

They were powerful - very powerful. Although their proposal was phrased as a generous offer, we could not help but notice that their fortresses had positioned themselves over our armories and population centers, and none of their fortresses were unarmed. We did not think we could fight them; we considered waking Father for help, but we weren't sure he could fight them either. In desperation, we met and devised a plan: we would seal Urh'Rok away, prevent him from waking up unless disturbed, and then tell the Sher'Tul what we had done. Father would not be hurt or injured by this - he simply wouldn't know what was going on.

We did this, and came to the Sher'Tul. They begrudgingly accepted our treacherous act as a pledge of loyalty to them, and came through with their end of the bargain, giving us knowledge and artifacts beyond our wildest dreams. They built powerful portals all over our planet, allowing us to travel through them not only within our world, but within every world the Sher'Tul had visited before. We saw wonderful new worlds, met and traded with peaceful species from across the universe, enjoyed all kinds of new, alien food, music, magic, and inventions, and generally could not have been happier with how things turned out - if not for the pangs of guilt we felt for betraying our Father. The Sher'Tul eventually stopped visiting us, but we kept trading with new people we met through the portal, and did not notice their absence.

Then everything broke.
]], [[他们乘着巨大的飞行堡垒前来，上面装满了各种武器，即使在远处也可以感受到它放射出来的强大魔法力量。他们没有直接威胁我们，但是他们和我们的领袖会面，像我们提出了一个交易——同时也是一个最后通牒：他们将动手杀掉父亲，或者选择我们自己动手干掉他，这样他们将会赠予给我们他们所有用的科技和魔法。

他们很强大——十分强大。尽管他们的交易看上去是一个慷慨的赠予，我们也情不自禁地发现，他们的堡垒全都全副武装，所有的武器系统都瞄准了我们的兵工厂和人口中心。我们觉得我们无法击败他们；我们曾想过叫醒父亲来帮助我们，但是我们害怕即使是父亲或许也无法击败他们。在绝望之中，我们最终确定了一个计划：我们将会把乌鲁洛克封印起来，让他除非被强大的力量打扰否则不会醒来，并告诉夏·图尔人我们所做的事。父亲不会被这样的封印所伤害——他甚至不知道之后发生了什么。

我们做了这些，并且告知了夏·图尔人。他们勉强同意把我们背叛的行为当作是对他们忠诚的象征，按照约定，他们给了我们许多的知识和充满奥术力量的神器——这些东西超越了我们最狂野的梦想。他们在我们星球的各处建造了强大的传送门，让我们不仅可以在我们的星球随处穿行，还可以到达夏·图尔人所访问过的任何一个地方。我们看到了美好的新世界，与宇宙各处友好的生物互相会面，互相交易，享受来自各个星球的食物、音乐、魔法和各种发明。这几乎是我们最快乐的日子——如果不是我们心中还坏着背叛父亲的深深愧疚之情的话。夏·图尔人最终停止了对我们的访问，但我们仍然继续着利用传送门和其他地方的人联络交易，并没有注意到它们突然消失了。

然而，就在此时，美好的生活突然破碎了。

t([[Waves of terrible magic burst forth from the portals, which it's now clear were never intended to help us. They were a deadly trap, a ticking time bomb that would go off when the Sher'Tul wanted it to - and it went off with incredible force. Most of the worlds we had once visited were obliterated completely. Ours was not, but I can barely say we were "spared"; our Father's jungles turned to a cursed pyre instantly, burning with flame that could never be extinguished, and our planet cracked apart, whole continents flying into the void. What little land was left obviously couldn't be used for farming. Most of us died instantly, the survivors being those close enough to a skilled mage who could create enough oxygen to breathe, and convert ambient magic into caloric energy for our bodies. Life for the survivors was - is - endless torment, the burning ground constantly searing our feet, and all the beauty we once knew destroyed.

Fortunately, this woke our Father up. We confessed our treachery, but did not beg forgiveness, as we knew what we had done was unforgivable; he disagreed, and to this day is using nearly every shred of his power to keep the shattered fragments of our planet together. We were not satisfied with this fate, our Father suffering and exhausting himself for the sake of our mistakes. We begged him to give us a command, something we could do to help his situation, or at least make him happier about it.

His command: End the Sher'Tul. End their creations. Never let anything be hurt by Eyal again.

We have taken his words to heart. Our mages have devised new magic from old inspiration, alteration spells to make us warlike and brutal once more - but with our ascended minds and honed bodies, we shall be a force of destruction far greater than the dust-storms ever were. Our green bretheren underwent a process to make their skin drip with acid; not to be outdone, our onyx brethren grew faster and stronger, with a birth-rate high enough to overwhelm whatever Sher'Tul or Sher'Tul-made monsters lay on Eyal. The red ones proclaimed they now existed only to destroy, and fused bits of the burnt earth to their hands, leaving them unable to do anything but sear Eyal with its own fires. The finished results of these alterations have taken up residence on our largest drifting continent, the one drawing ever closer to Eyal.

Once this continent arrives, we shall take revenge on Eyal. Not just for our own sakes, our planet ravaged by their treachery, with a pristine one waiting as our prize. Not just for our Father's sake, condemned to an eternity of suffering for trusting his children too much. But for *everyone's* sake, the untold trillions of souls on planets less fortunate than ours, torn apart in a fiery instant. The Sher'Tul shall never hurt anyone again; we shall make sure of it by cleansing Eyal in blighted fire, and any survivors will be taken back to our planet and chained to the burning earth, kept alive so they can forever feel the flames they created consuming their flesh. Their eternal torture will still not be justice, as they shall feel only a tiny portion of the suffering they inflicted... but it's a start.
]], [[很显然，夏·图尔人从来没有真心想要过帮助我们。在那一天，一股可怕的破坏性魔法能量从所有的传送门中放射出来。这一切都是他们设置的死亡陷阱，这些传送门都是具有强大力量的定时炸弹，只要夏·图尔人想要就会随时爆炸。大部分我们曾经访问过的世界几乎被瞬间湮灭。我们的世界仍然残存，但是被强大的爆炸力量炸了个粉碎：我们父亲创造的丛林被魔法能量的诅咒下瞬间变成了冲天的永恒火柱，燃烧的火焰永远无法被任何方法扑灭，我们的星球被炸裂开来，大部分的大陆都被消失在无尽的虚空之中。即使是残留下来的少许土地，也永远无法用于耕种。我们中的大部分人当场死亡，剩下来极其少数的强大法师试着用魔法创造了用于呼吸的氧气，将周围涌动的魔法能量转化成我们身体所需要的能量。对于那些幸存者来说，生命宛如无尽的折磨，燃烧的大地在我们的脚下灼烧，我们曾见过的一切美好事物都被焚毁殆尽。

幸运的是，这场天灾地变惊醒了我们的父亲。我们为我们背叛的行为深深忏悔，然而我们不是为了乞求原谅，因为我们所做的一切永远没法被原谅。他并不同意，使用了他全部的力量将我们破碎的星球重新维持在了一起。我们对这样不公命运感到十分痛心，我们的父亲因为我们的错误不得不而竭尽全力受尽磨难，却仍然决意为我们付出。我们向他祈求，希望他向我们下达命令。我们愿意做任何我们能做的来帮助他，至少能够让他感到喜悦。

他的命令是：终结夏·图尔人。终结他们的造物。让埃亚尔的住民再也无法危害人间。

我们将他的话铭记在心。我们的法师从过去被我们废弃的法术中获取灵感，创造了新的法术，让我们再一次变得好战和残忍——然而，我们的意志早已变得更加坚定，我们的身体早已锻炼得更加强韧，我们将会成为毁灭一切的力量——比那些过去的尘土风暴更加可怕。我们绿翡翠色的同胞让他们的皮肤上滴落酸液，缟玛瑙之子也不甘示弱，强化自己的身体，让自己更高、更快、更强。红宝石之子更是声称他们唯一存在的意义就是为了毁灭一切，他们将我们星球上永久灼烧的土地融合在他们的手上，失去双手的他们无法做任何事情，毕生的精力都将用于以他们的烈火将埃亚尔的一切燃烧殆尽。我们的生育率也大大提高，远远超过了埃亚尔上的夏·图尔人和他们创造的一切怪物。最终，这些变化了自身的同胞在我们星球飘逸在外的最大碎片上定居，操纵着碎片在埃亚尔的上空盘旋。

当这块大陆的碎片降临埃亚尔，我们将开始我们真正的复仇。那不仅仅是为了我们自己的原因：我们的星球被他们的背信弃义所蹂躏，只有将它们的自己完好无损的星球作为战利品才能补偿我们的损失。那不仅仅是为了我们父亲的原因：因为太过信任自己的孩子，他遭受了这样永恒的磨难和苦痛。那是为了世界上的所有人：那些在无数星球上受苦受难的亿万生灵，他们没有像我们那样的幸运，在灾难中瞬间被烈火吞噬。夏·图尔人再也不能这样为害人间，我们将用枯萎之火净化整个埃亚尔。任何残存的生还者将会被带到我们的星球，绑在无尽灼烧的土地上经受永恒的折磨，让他们体会自己所造下的罪孽和折磨降临到自己身上的感觉。即使这样也不足以弥补它们所做的恶行，他们所将经历的只是他们所造成的邪恶的一小部分……但是这将是一个开始。

"All right, bring in the next one," says the ruby-skinned leader.  A few small, green and black things mop up the pile of muck that used to be a dwarf, and you move to the front of the line and stand where he used to be.  On the other side of the room, another <?=_t(player.descriptor.subrace, "birth descriptor name")?> stands on an identical platform.  This is exciting - you've been specially chosen as a test subject!  You hope you help them find something effective AND agonizing, and look forward to the pain to come.  A green imp, a little more mutated and knobbly than the rest you've seen, stands on your side of the room and grins at you with anticipation;  on the other side, a more normal imp approaches your counterpart.  "Control group...  go."  The normal wretchling leaps on the <?=_t(player.descriptor.subrace, "birth descriptor name")?>'s face, clutching it tight as a torrent of acid oozes from its skin, then lets go; the red imp looks at his melting flesh, jots down some notes, then mutters "and pain blocks off..."  The <?=_t(player.descriptor.subrace, "birth descriptor name")?>'s smile vanishes, and he clutches his face, then lets out a howling scream, collapses, and begins writhing on the floor.  The red imp looks down again, gives a bored sigh, and takes some more notes.  "That's enough, pain blocks on, patch him up."  The <?=_t(player.descriptor.subrace, "birth descriptor name")?> stops moving, stands up, and smiles again, the acid continuing to eat away at his flesh until a pipe in the floor douses him with some sort of chemical.  Another red imp mutters something and waves his hands before taking his hand and leading him off, and you see his horrible wounds gradually healing.

"Experimental group...  go."  With speed you can't even process until it's already on you, the mutant wretchling leaps onto your face.  You feel no pain as its acid leaks over your torso, although you do feel an odd sensation of your skin layers beginning to dissolve.  The imp leaps off again; apparently it missed your eyes, because you can see the red imp looking somewhat disappointed.  "Structural damage subpar...  okay, pain blocks off."  You know you're not supposed to scream during this next part.

You scream.  You scream harder than you have in your life, to the point where you think you might be tearing your vocal cords apart.  The pain is stronger not just than any pain you've ever felt, but any sensation you've ever felt.  You fall to the ground and claw at your skin, tearing off bits of it as you try to get the acid off.  You struggle and flail, instinctively grabbing at anything that could help you even though you know there's nothing in reach that could.

"All right, nice!  Pain blocks on!"  And just like that, the pain vanishes; your skin still bubbles, but that horrible pain is gone, and even your throat isn't sore.  "Clean him and patch him up.  Pain-amplifying qualities...  significant improvement...  recommend breeding with low-pain high-corrosion specimens."  A shower of unidentifiable goo washes over you, and your skin stops bubbling; your handler takes your arm and leads you away, muttering a healing spell under his breath, and your scars slowly start to fade into smooth skin once again.  You hope they aren't too harsh on you for screaming, but the way that imp spoke...  you must've helped them learn something!  You grin from ear to ear as you leave the room, hearing the red imp yell "Next!" as the door closes behind you.

“实验组……开始”你还没反应过来，那只变异的酸液树魔已经踩在你脸上了。当酸液滴落在你躯干上时，你并没有感到疼痛，只有一种古怪的皮肤消融的感觉。小恶魔再次低头向下看；显然他漏看了你的眼睛，因为你能看到他神色中的失望。“结构伤害……好的，痛苦阻断解除”你认为下一步骤里大家都期望着你不会发出尖叫。

你尖叫着，痛苦地尖叫着，发出你一生从未有过的哀嚎，你甚至以为自己的声带将被撕裂。这痛苦比以往的任何痛苦更加强烈，比任何感觉都要强烈。你跌倒在地，用手抓挠着皮肤，希望将酸液除去。你挣扎着，抓挠着，攥住手边任何东西，希望能解除痛苦，尽管你心里清楚这并不可能。

“很好，非常好！痛苦阻断打开！”刚听到这里，刚才的痛苦顿时消失了；你的皮肤仍在颤抖，但痛苦不再，甚至喉咙也不疼了。“洗干净，带下去。痛苦加倍……重要改进……建议同低痛高腐蚀型杂交。”一股不知名的液体朝你喷射，你的皮肤不再溶解。你的“主人”抓住你的胳膊，带着你离开，同时向你释放治疗法术。你的伤痕消褪了。你希望他们不会因为你的尖叫而对你加以惩处，不过，从你听到的只言片语，你应该对他们有所帮助。想到这里，你不禁咧嘴笑了，身后的门关闭时，回响着那只小恶魔叫喊“下一个”的声音。

This slippery little <?=_t(player.descriptor.subrace, "birth descriptor name")?> has proven to be a thorn in our side so far.

That said, given that <?=player:he_she()?> has increased dramatically in power since <?=player:his_her()?> escape, it is crucial that we keep proper tactics in mind.  Having been exposed to our alteration magic, <?=player:he_she()?> is very formidable in direct melee combat, and in the event that we cannot procure proper warding against this magic before <?=player:his_her()?> arrival, <?=player:he_she()?> can cause significant damage if not properly handled.  Under no circumstances should we let <?=player:him_her()?> run rampant in our back line; furthermore, if we simply try to lure <?=player:him_her()?> into a narrow corridor, we will not be able to bring enough firepower to bear before <?=player:he_she()?> can break through our obstructions.  Instead, use a small flanking squad backed up by a maulotaur (or whatever high-power direct combatant we can get authorization to deploy) to force <?=player:him_her()?> into an open area, where we'll have caster artillery, protected by a front-line of wretchlings backed by quasits.  We may lose these front-line soldiers, but in the time it takes <?=player:him_her()?> to slash <?=player:his_her()?> way through them, our spells should be able to reduce <?=player:him_her()?> to a flayed, quivering wreck.

Above all else, remember: despite <?=player:his_her()?> brute strength, this is a pitiful, inferior Eyalite who lucked <?=player:his_her()?> way into obtaining some of our superior power.  <?=player:he_she():capitalize()?> does not know how to use it properly, and does not have the countless years of experience with it that we do.  We have numbers, familiarity, tactics, and the blessing of Urh'Rok himself.  Treat this like a drill; if we stay calm and focused, it is unlikely we will see any casualties.

这就是说，由于<?=player:he_she()?>的实力从<?=player:his_her()?>上一次逃跑开始计算已经大幅增长，把明确的战略战术铭记在心对我们来说是极为重要的。长期曝露在我们的改良魔法之下，<?=player:he_she()?>在近战格斗中表现令人生畏。如果我们在<?=player:he_she()?>到来前妥善组织防御对抗他的魔法，<?=player:he_she()?>可能会对我们的部队造成极大的损伤。我们在任何情况下都绝不能让<?=player:him_her()?>击穿我们部队的后防线；也就是说，如果我们仅仅是把<?=player:him_her()?>引诱到一个狭窄的角落，我们的火力或许没有办法阻止他冲破重围。正确的方法应当是，先用一支由玛诺陶（或者其他任何我们能够调动的高阶近战部队）带领的佯攻小队将<?=player:him_her()?>引诱到空旷地带，然后让我们的法师部队在前线酸液树魔和夸塞魔的掩护下发动攻击。我们可能会损失大量的前线部队，但是这可以有效阻拦<?=player:him_her()?>前进的脚步。在此期间，我们的法术力量足以将他打成马蜂窝。

That said, given that <?=player:he_she()?> has increased dramatically in power since <?=player:his_her()?> escape, it is crucial that we keep proper tactics in mind.  We've heard disturbing reports that some of our species have been spotted fighting alongside <?=player:him_her()?>; we can assume that <?=player:he_she()?> is using a twisted version of the Tablet's power to enslave some of our forces.  Much of <?=player:his_her()?> combat potential comes from these thralls, rather than <?=player:his_her()?> own abilities.  Accordingly, there are three things to keep in mind:

-Prioritize the Eyalite, rather than <?=player:his_her()?> thralls.  We do not yet have a concrete understanding of how <?=player:he_she()?> is controlling our allies, but it seems likely that the mental hold will break once <?=player:he_she()?>'s incapacitated; if <?=player:he_she()?> has managed to take control of a Champion of Urh'Rok or similarly powerful agent, we should focus our firepower on <?=player:him_her()?> instead.  That said, neutralizing <?=player:him_her()?> is more important than saving the time and effort of producing such a creature; in particular, don't worry about catching a few enthralled imps in the crossfire.  No matter what <?=player:he_she()?>'s using, we can make more of it.

-Be ready for anything.  We've never needed to plan out what to do against our own powers, and we have such a diverse set of species that <?=player:he_she()?> could throw all kinds of magic or martial prowess against us.  This might sound hopeless, but remember: you've seen all this in action before, these powers being used alongside yours in training and in combat.  Whatever you've seen your comrades do, expect to see it from <?=player:him_her()?>.

-Do not assume that the onslaught will stop if all of <?=player:his_her()?> thralls are dead.  <?=player:he_she():capitalize()?> has managed to directly imbue <?=player:his_her_self()?> with some of our magic, and may be capable of using our fireballs, acidic bursts, and so forth.  Silencing magic will be helpful here, as will spells that can drain <?=player:his_her()?> energy; furthermore, ripping away <?=player:his_her()?> shield will make <?=player:him_her()?> especially vulnerable to our claws and axes.

Above all else, remember: despite <?=player:his_her()?> enthralled minions, this is a pitiful, inferior Eyalite who lucked <?=player:his_her()?> way into obtaining some of our superior power.  <?=player:he_she():capitalize()?> does not know how to use it properly, and does not have the countless years of experience with it that we do.

这就是说，由于<?=player:he_she()?>的实力从<?=player:his_her()?>上一次逃跑开始计算已经大幅增长，把明确的战略战术铭记在心对我们来说是极为重要的。我们收到了一些令人不安的消息，据说有人目击到一些我们的同族和<?=player:him_her()?>一起战斗；我们猜测，<?=player:he_she()?>一定是使用了某种和石板的力量类似的方法来奴役了我们的一些部队。显然，<?=player:his_her()?>大部分的战斗能力来自其所操纵的恶魔的力量，而不是<?=player:his_her()?>自己的能力。因此，有三件事情我们必须始终铭记在心。

—集中火力对付那个埃亚尔人，而不是那些被<?=player:he_she()?>奴役的恶魔。我们目前尚不能准确地了解到底<?=player:he_she()?>是怎么控制那些恶魔的，不过显然，只要击败<?=player:he_she()?>那些精神枷锁就会立刻解除。如果<?=player:he_she()?>不知怎么地召唤出了乌鲁洛克的精英卫兵这样的强力恶魔，我们必须把火力集中在<?=player:him_her()?>本人身上。从另外一方面来说，将<?=player:him_her()?>彻底消灭比制造恶魔的时间和精力要重要得多。因此，不用担心走火意外击中<?=player:he_she()?>所奴役的几只小酸液树魔这样的事情而担心太多。无论<?=player:he_she()?>手中有多少恶魔，我们的战争机器永远能够制造更多。

—准备好面对任何困难的处境。我们从来没有做过与我们的同族作战的准备，并且由于我们的族类十分丰富，<?=player:he_she()?>可以施展各种各样的魔法和战争技巧来对付我们。这听上去似乎有点绝望，不过，请记住：无论怎样，<?=player:he_she()?>所施展的技能你之前都曾经亲身经历过，他的能力都是你在锻炼和战斗中所见过的能力。只要想想你的同志们曾经使用过什么技能，你就能想到<?=player:him_her()?>将会使用的技能了。

—不要在击败了所有被奴役的恶魔之后就对<?=player:his_her()?>掉以轻心，似乎<?=player:he_she()?>已经掌握了某种把恶魔的力量和<?=player:his_her_self()?>结合的方法，足以释放近战火球，酸性爆发等一系列技能。一定要及时对其释放沉默魔法，或者任何可以吸干<?=player:his_her()?>的生命能量的方法。另外，用缴械技能卸下<?=player:his_her()?>的盾牌，<?=player:him_her()?>在我们的刀枪剑斧面前就会显得无比脆弱。

最重要的是：请记住，尽管<?=player:his_her()?>不知怎么奴役了我们的一些同类，<?=player:he_she()?>只是一个可怜的，下等的埃亚尔人，只是出于幸运才有机会窃取了我们恶魔的强大力量。<?=player:he_she()?>并不真正了解如何正确使用自己的能力，也不像我们那样有着长期丰富的作战经验。我们有数量优势、有团结精神、有战术协作、还有乌鲁洛克大人的祝福。像对待演习一样对待这场战斗，只要保持审慎和专注，我们不会受到什么损失。

That said, given that <?=player:he_she()?> has increased dramatically in power since <?=player:his_her()?> escape, it is crucial that we keep proper tactics in mind.  Our standard alterations have synergized with this Shalore's natural reactive magic, giving <?=player:him_her()?> short-range teleportation to rival Draebor and creating a frustratingly evasive target to hit.  Even <?=player:his_her()?> internal organs are affected, and will slide out of the way in anticipation of a blow that would strike an otherwise-vital area.  Compared to standard Shalore, <?=player:he_she()?> cannot directly turn invisible, but seems to have adopted a form of dúathedlen magic to remain out of sight all the same; if the requisition order for light-based wards goes through, this and the blasts of darkness this form grants should both be a non-issue.  Finally, use of more advanced combat maneuvers will be somewhat impeded by <?=player:his_her()?> ability to interfere with our concentration, and the resilience alterations we gave <?=player:him_her()?> will make <?=player:him_her()?> shrug off poisons, flames, and the like much quicker than usual.

What does all this mean?  Just get <?=player:him_her()?> wounded, wait for <?=player:him_her()?> to try to teleport away, then get <?=player:him_her()?> in a corner and beat <?=player:him_her()?> until <?=player:he_she()?> stops moving.

Just work that into our standard methods of dealing with <?=string.a_an(_t(player.descriptor.subclass, "birth descriptor name"):lower())?>, remember not to break ranks if <?=player:he_she()?> vanishes into darkness, and we'll have this mess cleaned up in no time.

Above all else, remember: despite <?=player:his_her()?> enhancements, this is a pitiful, inferior Eyalite who lucked <?=player:his_her()?> way into obtaining some of our superior power.  <?=player:he_she():capitalize()?> does not know how to use it properly, and does not have the countless years of experience with it that we do.

这就是说，由于<?=player:he_she()?>的实力从<?=player:his_her()?>上一次逃跑开始计算已经大幅增长，把明确的战略战术铭记在心对我们来说是极为重要的。我们调整了永恒精灵天赋的加速能力，让<?=player:him_her()?>可以像小恶魔德瑞宝那样使用短距离传送技能，并在传送后大幅提升闪避能力。就连<?=player:his_her()?>内部器官也受到了影响，使其可以自动把一些瞄准要害的攻击转移到其他并不那么重要的地方。与普通的永恒精灵相比，<?=player:he_she()?>并不能直接隐身，但似乎采取了转化成多瑟顿的方式来隐藏自己。即使有人使用照明的方式寻找到了<?=player:him_her()?>的位置，也可以使用多瑟顿制造暗影爆炸的能力来解决问题。此外，<?=player:he_she()?>可以集中精力冲击对方的精神来打断对方的高级战斗策略，并且在恶魔空间的试炼增强了<?=player:his_her()?>的韧性，使其可以快速摆脱异常状态。

这意味着什么？很显然，只需要先击伤<?=player:him_her()?>，等着<?=player:him_her()?>自己选择传送逃跑，然后乘胜追击将<?=player:him_her()?>堵在狭小的角落发动集中攻击直到其放弃移动。就是这么简单，接下来只要考虑我们对付<?=_t(player.descriptor.subclass)?>的一般策略就可以了。记住，在<?=player:he_she()?>潜入黑暗的时候不要轻举妄动，保持阵型，很快我们就能将其击败。

t([[Necromancy. It has been a long practiced artform on our world, though it fell into disuse during the golden years of Urh'Rok. When the Sher'Tul annihilated our home, however, we resumed our studies on the use of this dark art.

Onilugs are Children of Onyx who have completely given themselves over to Death. The transformation process is both horrifying and painful, but the result is a demon fully tuned to manipulating necrotic energies. Their flesh has become dry and emaciated, making them appear as skeletal creatures draped in skin.  We salute those brave enough to undergo the transformation, for their work advances our cause of Eyal's destruction.

As they are no longer truly alive, onilugs do not fear the void of space. They may wander across the burnt landscape, not afraid of suffocation, the fires of the spellblaze or arcane radiation.

Eyalites may be forced to undergo the Onilug transformation as well. It has actually worked out beautifully. Countless half-wit necromancers, too blinded by their own ambition, have willingly come to us, offering their frail Eyalite flesh to undergo the Onilug transformation. Dangle but a drop of power in front of them and they will snap at it like half-starved wolves.

Our onilug researchers continue to elevate the craft of Necromancy to greater heights, designing new undead creatures to unleash in our inevitable invasion of Eyal's surface.

欧尼路格是那些完全将自己献身给死亡的缟玛瑙之子。这一转化的过程恐怖而痛苦，最终，他们成为了能够完全适应操纵不死能量的恶魔。他们的肉体变得干枯憔悴，如同只披着一层皮的骷髅一般。我们向勇于接受这一改造的同胞致敬，是他们的献身让我们朝着毁灭埃亚尔的目标更近了一步。

因为他们已经不再是生者，欧尼路格无需惧怕宇宙的虚空。他们可以在烧焦的大地上游走，不需要呼吸，也不再惧怕魔法大爆炸的火焰和奥术的辐射。

埃亚尔人也可以被迫接受欧尼路格的改造。我们已经产生了不少成功的例子。无数的半吊子死灵法师，被自己的野心蒙蔽了双眼，心甘情愿的来到我们面前，献出自己虚弱的埃亚尔人肉体，接受改造成为欧尼路格。只要把一点点力量在他们眼前晃动一下，他们就会像饿狼一样猛扑上来，自寻死路。

Hello, Eyalite.  The text here wouldn't have meant a whole lot to you; a whole lot of blathering about his accomplishments as a naturalist, and his mysterious disappearance.  Let me tell you what you need to know instead.

Kryl-Feijan was my lover, and along with a friend by the name of Walrog we came to Eyal out of curiosity and thirst for knowledge.  It was an enlightening hobby, and the reports we made of your many, primitive species were read all across our world.  Do not think you deserved this attention; you were not special in any way aside from your inferiority.  How could the planet of the powerful, intelligent Sher'Tul create such savages that had barely escaped feudalism?  Your sins were endearing, and your failures amusing.  And it was knowing this, along with the curious absence of the Sher'Tul, that led us to go out and investigate when a wounded child of onyx came through our portal, deactivated it, and told us of horrible destruction unleashed on Mal'Rok by Eyal.  We knew you were not capable of such feats, so we had to learn the answers for ourselves; Kryl-Feijan and I adopted our usual disguises as human mages, while Walrog arranged to scout the seas for anomalies, then meet us back after a few days.

When we emerged from our underground lodge, we were surprised to see firestorms (although not nearly so fierce) raging across Eyal as well.  What surprised us more, though, was an enraged horde of peasants, provoked by our unfortunate choice of disguises - in your ignorance, you chose to blame spellcasters for the disaster.  We tried to escape, but the mob swarmed us from all directions, and were soon upon us.

Soon, I was tied up and restrained, while they gloated and made threats I couldn't hear over the din of the crowd.  I could have fought back, but I kept telling myself only to lash out once I was sure my life was in danger, reassuring myself that the people of Eyal who were once so fascinating to me surely couldn't be aware of what they were doing.  Judging from the geysers of flame bursting above my head, my lover was not so patient; when the blasts stopped and the crowd started to clear away, I saw why he'd fought so fiercely.  His injuries were horrific, clearly done to make him suffer rather than incapacitate him, and he was on the edge of death.  In a moment of desperation, I muttered a spell to myself to understand what was going through their minds, what could possibly justify such treatment.  That's when I learned what they'd done to him, and what they were planning with me, but neither was as awful as the unthinking hate motivating it...  there are both too many words for it and not enough.  Horrible, barbaric, sadistic, all are accurate but none fully convey the evil of it.  That moment is when I learned the true savagery of Eyal, and realized the fate all Eyalites deserve.  That moment is when my patience broke.

There is a type of magic on Mal'Rok that will allow one to transfer his or her life-essence to another, prolonging the latter's lifespan at the expense of the former.  Voluntary donations to honored figures are popular, but the reverse - draining another to help one's self - was considered the gravest of sins, a statement that you considered your life to be worth more than another's, which is a decision nobody should be allowed to make when they have a vested interest in it.  Walrog had taught this forbidden spell to me, and only now did I use it, withering the horde all at once and forcing their lives into Kryl-Feijan.  The survivors, too weak to stand up against me, suffered greatly, playthings of my brief and furious revenge.  Unfortunately, even all the life I'd drained was not quite enough to restore my lover to health; all it could do was keep him in limbo, in incredible pain and unable to act, but still alive.

I took his surviving essence and fled to safety, then started picking the natives off one by one, extending my lifespan and getting ever closer to restoring him to health.  I can only assume Walrog is doing the same, preying on sailors first and then naga; I've lost contact with him, but the stories of terrors from the sea tell me he's still alive.  Keeping Kryl-Feijan in limbo consumes a great deal of energy, though, and soon lone travellers were not enough to keep him stable; I needed others to work for me, gathering victims and willingly sacrificing themselves once they'd outlived their usefulness.  And that is when I learned of the approach of the Fearscape, and came up with an offer I could make to the residents of Eyal.

When the legions of Urh'Rok manage to get an invasion force to Eyal's surface - not if, but when - you will all suffer, more than you can possibly imagine.  Many of you will die; some will not be so lucky, and will be an ever-living target of their rage, tortured until the end of time.  Their reasons are somewhat inaccurate, but make no mistake: you deserve the fate they have lined up for you.  Even if I wanted to, neither I nor anything else in the universe could stop their invasion, save the word of Urh'Rok himself - and that seems rather unlikely.  If you assist me and follow my orders to my satisfaction, I can guarantee you two things.  One, your inevitable agonizing fate WILL end in death, after a maximum of a couple of weeks; even the armies of Mal'Rok can't undo the effects of having your life-essence drained.  And two, before you feel the pain, you will feel nearly-equal pleasure.  With my magical skills, I can alter myself into any form, create all manner of illusions, and manipulate all your senses to your liking.  Your wildest, most unrealistic fantasies will become true; the time before the pain starts will be so enjoyable as to eclipse every moment of your pathetic lives that came before.  And if you think yourself above such hedonism, consider the psionically-gifted servitors I've recently acquired, and the way they could change your memories - when the "demons" are dripping acid into your eyes, then growing them back with more nerve endings than before so you can feel the pain more acutely, won't it be much more bearable if you're under the delusion that you've made a selfless sacrifice to save Eyal, and that your children and loved ones aren't suffering the same fate?

Countless others have agreed to this deal in the millenia before you were even born, and I have amassed enough essence to contain Kryl-Feijan in a stable "seed."  Once it is planted in a suitable victim and allowed to grow, he will once again walk Eyal, far more powerful than he was before, and the two of us will do everything we can to speed up your miserable world's much-deserved death.  Technically, any sentient and fleshy body would work, but I'd like someone who'll be missed, whose death will allow my lover's first act in rebirth to cause great misery to Eyal.  If you'd like to accept my deal, come unarmed and alone to the Crypt of Kryl-Feijan, and join your fellow Eyalites in servitude to me.  And if you were to bring a suitable host for my lover...  well, that'd be deserving of some special, one-on-one attention, wouldn't it?

Eyal is doomed to perish in screaming agony.  Wouldn't you at least like a good-bye kiss first?

-S.]], [[#{italic}#这座雕像底座上原有的文字已经被刮掉，一段笔记被留在了那里。#{normal}#

你好，埃亚尔人。这里原本的文字对你们来说并不重要：只不过是一个博物学者喋喋不休地讲述他的成就和谜一般的失踪。我来讲一些你们应当知道的东西。

卡洛·斐济是我的爱人。出于好奇和对知识的渴望，我们与一位朋友——乌尔罗格——来到了埃亚尔大陆。这个爱好带给我们很多启发，我们撰写的关于埃亚尔大陆原始物种的报告，在我们的世界被广泛传阅。别以为你们值得这样的注意；除了劣等，你们别无其他特质。孕育了强大，聪慧的夏·图尔人的这颗行星是怎么创造你们这样还没脱离封建社会的野蛮人的？你们的罪孽让人欣喜，你们的失败令人发笑。正是因为这，再加上夏·图尔人的神秘失踪，当那名受伤的缟玛瑙之子穿过并关闭了我们的传送门，告诉我们埃亚尔大陆给玛·洛克带来了可怕的毁灭时，我们立刻知道你们没能力实现这样的壮举。所以我们决定亲自出发寻找事件的真相。卡洛·斐济和我像往常一样变装为人类法师，乌尔罗格则在海上搜寻异常，并在几天后与我们会面。

从地底的居所出发后，我们惊讶的发现火焰风暴（尽管没那么猛烈）也在埃亚尔大陆肆虐。更令我们吃惊的是大量的无知难民，将这一切归罪于魔法师。我们的伪装正好激怒了他们。我们试图从暴民中脱身，但是人群蜂拥而至，最后控制了我们。

很快，我就被绑起来，他们满意地看着我们，并且发出种种威胁，然而嘈杂的人声淹没了他的声音，我没能听清楚。我本可以反击，然而我一直忍耐，想着只要在真正有性命之虞的时候抽身逃走就行，不停地劝慰自己，那些曾经对我来说多么吸引人的埃亚尔住民们根本不知道他们在做什么。然而，一连串在我头上爆炸的火焰显示出我的爱人显然没有那么耐心。当爆炸平息，人群散开的时候，我终于知道他为什么如此凶猛地反击了。他受了很严重的伤，明显是为了让他受苦而不是限制他的行动，他就快死了。在一瞬的绝望之后，我低声念出了咒语，读取了他们的思想，了解他们为什么如此对待我的爱人。于是我知道了他们对我的爱人做了什么，以及他们将要对我做些什么，更可怕的是支配他们行动的那不假思索的憎恨……有很多词可以用来形容，可憎的、野蛮的、虐待狂的，都很准确，但是却无法描述那其中的邪恶。正是在那时，我了解了埃亚尔的野蛮，以及所有埃亚尔人应得的命运。同时，我的忍耐已经突破了极限。

玛·洛克的世界里有这样一种魔法，它可以让一个人把他的生命精华转移给另一个人，以前者的生命为代价，延长后者的寿命。对受人尊敬的名人志愿奉献生命很常见，但是反之——汲取别人的生命来帮助自己——被认为是最严重的罪行。这等同于宣称你的生命比其他人的更有价值。当人们能从中获得利益的时候，这样的权衡是不被允许的。乌尔罗格曾将这个禁咒传授给我，也只有在那时我使用了这个咒语，使暴民们的生命全部枯萎，并将它们转移到卡洛·斐济体内。即使是幸存的暴民，也承受了巨大的痛苦，摇摇欲坠，成为了我疾风暴雨般复仇的牺牲品。不幸的是，我汲取来的所有生命也不足以让我的爱人恢复健康，仅仅能让他在地狱门前徘徊，忍受着无尽的痛苦，丧失行动的能力，苟延残喘。

我带着他仅存的精华逃跑到安全的地方，然后开始一个接一个的夺走埃亚尔人的精华，延长我的寿命，并尽可能的让他恢复健康。我猜想乌尔罗格也在这么做，捕食水手，然后是娜迦。我们失去了联系，但是一些海上的恐怖传说让我相信他还活着。维持卡洛·斐济的生存消耗了许多能量，再过不久，独行的旅人已经不足以使他的状况稳定。我需要其他人为我工作，收集牺牲品，并在物尽其用之后奉献生命。那时我学会了进入恐惧空间，并且想出了一个给埃亚尔人的提议。

总有一天，乌鲁洛克的军团将对埃亚尔展开侵略。你们都会遭受难以想象的痛苦。你们许多人都会死去。当然不是所有人都这么幸运，剩下那些会成为他们无尽狂怒的靶子，他们会一直折磨你直到时间的尽头。他们的理由是——或许不准确，但是我没有说错——“他们所安排的命运是你们应得的”。我或者宇宙中任何事物都没法阻止他们的侵略，尽管我很想这么做。恐怕只有乌鲁洛克本人可以拯救这个世界——这看起来也不太现实。如果你们能帮助我，并且服从我的命令，让我感到满意，我可以保证你们两件事：第一，你无法避免的可悲命运将会以死亡终结，最多只要几周的时间，哪怕乌鲁洛克的军队也无法在我汲取你们的生命精华之后撤销这个行动。第二，在你们感到痛苦之前，你们会感到等量的快乐。通过魔法，我可以让自己变成各种形态，生成各种各样的幻想，按你们的喜好操纵你们的感官。你们最疯狂最不现实的梦想将会成真。等待痛苦到来的时间将会变得令人愉悦，让你的之前的人生黯然失色。如果你们觉得不屑于这种享乐主义，那么我最近招纳的有心灵能力方面天赋的仆从值得考虑，他们可以改变你们的记忆。当“恶魔们”将酸液滴入你的眼球，再将它放回神经更加密集的地方去，于是你会感到更加剧烈的痛苦。如果这时，你产生了你在为拯救埃亚尔大陆而无私的奉献生命，并且你的爱人孩子不会承受如此痛苦的幻觉，你会不会感觉这一切更加容易忍耐了呢。

在你们诞生千年之前，数不清的其他人已经接受了这个提议，我积累了足够的精华将卡洛·斐济保存在一个稳定的“种子”之中。一旦将它种在合适的牺牲品之中放任生长，他将以更加强大的姿态重返埃亚尔大陆。我们两人将会用尽所有手段来加速你们可悲世界的应得的末日。理论上，任何有灵性的血肉之躯都可以作为种子的容器。但是我想要一个会被怀念的人，杀死他可以让我爱人重生的第一步给这个世界带来巨大的不幸。如果你接受我的提议，就卸下武装只身前往卡洛·斐济的地窖，与你的埃亚尔同胞一起为我效劳。如果你能给我的爱人带来一个合适的容器……很好，那将会得到某种特殊的、一对一的照顾，怎么样？

埃亚尔注定在痛苦的尖叫中灭亡。你们不想先来个告别之吻吗？

Perhaps the most prestigious of these, though, is the Divine Tournament of Tactics, by which our military leaders are selected.

Chosen by our process as the wisest tactical mind among our people, he was selected to meet with Urh'Rok himself to gain his approval to lead our forces in the invasion.  Urh'Rok was so impressed by Khulmanar that he used a significant portion of the little energy he's not using to hold our world together to build Khulmanar a new body, one strong enough to let him direct battles from the front-line without fear.  With a form and weapons granted by our Father, and a mind given his direct, enthusiastic approval, Khulmanar is considered to be the avatar of Urh'Rok, and his commands in battle are to be treated with the same reverence we would give to the words of Father himself.", [[自从我们被从尘埃法师的控制之下解放后，在乌尔洛克的命令和鼓动下，我们开始举办锦标赛。这个比赛，不像很多人想的那样，仅仅是为了测试直接的战斗。除此之外我们还有学术工作、专注、物理耐受、哲学等诸多其他领域的竞赛。或许，这其中最著名的当属神圣战术竞标赛，我们的军事领导人正是通过这个赛事选拔出来的。比赛包括一系列试炼，评估我们对战况进行分析和处理的能力，包括速度、伤亡、部署效率以及一些其他的因素。库马纳，缟玛瑙之子，是这些项目的冠军，并且在等待我们的大陆到达埃亚尔的大部分时间里，他都维持了统治地位。通过我们竞赛所筛选出的最杰出的战略大师，库马纳被乌鲁洛克亲自召见以获准统御我们的入侵部队。库马纳给乌鲁洛克留下了很深的印象，于是后者从他维持我们世界的力量以外的部分中抽取了很大一部分，为库马纳创造了一个全新的肉身，让他能够在前线无所畏惧的指引战斗。拥有我们的父所赐予的武器与躯壳，精神受到父的指引，库马纳被视作乌鲁洛克的化身，他在战场上的指令受到如同父一般的尊敬。

Rogroth generates countless essence-less seeds from within its frame, then embeds them in nearby living beings, so when they expire, their life-essence goes directly into the seed and allows it to grow.  We have not yet perfected its production capabilities, so currently the seeds will only become degenerate husks when they grow, but fear not!  As we get data from the tests of this design, we'll improve on it, and soon the slaughter of our foes will cause wretchlings, quasits, and even thaurheregs to spring up from their corpses.

Harkor'Zun, a being made mostly of stone, was simply dropped from our platform; the shield shattered him as expected, but we had designed him to survive this, the fragments merging back into their completed form once he reached the surface.

t([[Many in Maj'Eyal have heard of "demons", sadistic creatures who appear seemingly from nowhere, leaving a trail of suffering and destruction whereever they go.  Their Fearscape floats far above the skies, watching and waiting, but not idly; their agents scout the land, their legions build up their forces, and their scholars develop new spells and strategies.  As the barrier between our worlds begins to crack under their scrutiny, helpless Eyalites have begun to disappear, whisked up to serve as their slaves and playthings.  They imbue these victims with magical powers to better survive the ensuing stresses - can you use your new-found abilities to escape the legions of Mal'Rok?

Features:
* Start with a new class, the Doombringer!  These avatars of demonic destruction charge into battle with massive two-handed weapons, cutting swaths of firey devastation through hordes of opponents.  Armed with flame magic and demonic strength, they delight in fighting against overwhelming odds, softening up the crowd with waves of fire, then feeding on the flames and suffering of their surroundings to stay alive while quickly reducing any group to a pile of ash and gore.
* Unlock a new class, the Demonologist, with an all-new item enhancement mechanic!  Bearing a shield and the magic of the Spellblaze itself, these melee-fighting casters can grow demonic seeds from their fallen enemies.  Imbue these seeds onto your items to gain a wide array of new talents and passive benefits, and summon the demons within them to fight on your side!  Ever looked at a gigantic demon-cursed minotaur and wished it was on your side for once?  Well, now you CAN summon one to pound your foes into paste while you cast devastating spells from afar, or call forth a squad of Fire Imps to pelt your enemies to death while they exhaust themselves on your impenetrable defenses!  Demons have persistent health, making them a little more precious than disposable necromancer skeletons or summoner beasts, but can be revived from death nonetheless.
* Two new zones, with all-new art, foes, and bosses!  You've seen the plains of the Fearscape before, now see the lairs and headquarters of the demons themselves!
* Over 10,000 words of written lore to find!  The demons were once an enlightened, peaceful race, hailing from a distant planet known as Mal'Rok; learn what drove them to plot Eyal's eternal torture!  Discover monuments to each of the demonic species and noteworthy individuals, showing the place of honor each has among them!  Get a glimpse into the culture and daily lives of these sadistic invaders and their brainwashed thralls!
* Unlock a new race, Doomelves: Shalore who've taken to the demonic alterations especially well, corrupting their typical abilities into a darker form.  Blink away to safety, transform into a shadowy dúathedlen to hide in the shadows or prey on your foes with blasts of darkness, use your new resilience to soak up status effects and critical hits, and assault your enemies' minds to leave them unsteady in combat!
* Between the aforementioned classes and Doomelves, a whopping 75 new talents!
* Unlock two new cosmetic options!  You know you've always wanted demon-horns.  
* Two new events, appearing anywhere in Eyal!
* 20 new artifacts, with unique and interesting effects.  Collect the Obsidian Treasures to amass more and more power!  Slip your hands into the Will of Ul'Gruth and watch your sweeping blows smash down walls!  Wear a giant hideous hell-mouth as a fashionable belt!
* 7 new achievements!  Conquer the worst Urh'Rok's forces can throw at you, and hang their metaphorical skulls from your profile page!

You do not remember much of your life before you were on this burning continent, floating in the void between worlds.  You have been helping demons, happily participating in their experiments to shatter some sort of shield preventing them from taking their righteous revenge on Eyal.

You are being taken by your handler to the torture-pits to help them figure out how to cause the most pain to those on Eyal, when you hear a roaring above you; you look up and see a burning meteor, flying closer, and the demons' spells failing to divert its course!  It lands near you, knocking you off your feet with its shockwave and killing your handler instantly.

As you recover, and your platform of searing earth splits from the main continent, your old memories flood your mind and you come to your senses - the demons are out to destroy your home!
