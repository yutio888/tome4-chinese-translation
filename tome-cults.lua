Stranger still is the figure seated inside it. It appears to be wearing a suit made of an unknown material and a glass dome over its head. Looking inside the dome, you can plainly see that the figure is a dwarf! There is no mistaking that oversized nose. Judging by the smell, he has been dead for quite some time.

You are fairly sure that the dwarves aren't capable of making something like this and they definitely don't dress like that. So, where did this odd dwarf come from? Taking a closer look, you find a strange device attached to the dwarf's arm. You remove it with no small amount of effort. It is completely unlike anything you have seen before and you're not really sure what to make of it. Perhaps if you hold onto it, you might be able to discern its functionality later.]], [[出现在你眼前的是一个被绿色玻璃遮罩的太空舱，根据附近的弹坑判断，这个太空舱曾以极快的速度撞击地面，里面仍坐着一个奇怪的生物，穿着不明材质的衣服，带着绿色玻璃做成的头罩。透过绿色的玻璃看去，能看到矮人标志性的大鼻子，你清楚的发现这是一个矮人！从气味判断，他已经死了很久了。

你很肯定矮人不会做出这样的东西，而且他们绝对不会穿那样的衣服。那么，这个奇怪的矮人是从哪里来的？仔细观察，你会发现一个奇怪的装置附在矮人的手臂上。你不费吹灰之力就把它取下来了。这和你以前看到的任何东西都不一样，你也不知道该怎么做。如果你坚持住它，也许你可以在以后辨别出它的功能。]], "_t")

t([[I do not remember anything from before. My earliest memories are of these ruins. My people are known as the Drem to the surface dwellers of this world. We are seen as monsters, and perhaps that is not an unfair presumption. We were once mindless creatures roaming the underground, capable only of violence and acting on instinct. 

It is only after these ruins were found that thought finally manifested in our bodies. I am fortunate in that the ruins have gifted me with sublime intelligence. For some, it did not help at all. For others, it barely raised them above mindlessness. Whatever grants us intelligence in these ruins seems to work on a case-by-case basis. Since our self awareness is only a recent thing, we have much we need to learn about the world around us and about ourselves as well.

There is one question which keeps coming back to me. Why do we exist? Where did we come from? There are many strange things which dwell below the surface, but we are somehow different. The dwarven race bears similarities to us, but they possess a face where we do not. Are we cast from the same mold, but the process went awry somehow?

I strongly believe that Drem and Dwarf do share a common origin. But, what is that origin? Could this simply have been the result of our different environments over the years? I could speculate all day about this, but that would not produce any concrete evidence. I intend to explore these caverns until I can find some clue or fragment of knowledge which will point me in the right direction. I need to know the truth.]], [[我不记得以前的事了。我最早的记忆都和这些废墟有关。我的同伴被地上的居民称为德瑞姆。我们被视为怪物，也许这并非是一个不公的评价。我们曾经是在地下游荡的无意识的生物，依靠暴力和本能行动。

直到我们发现这些废墟之后，我们的身体中才浮现了智慧与思想。我很幸运，废墟赋予我崇高的智慧，而有一些人就没有那么幸运了，他们没有任何变化。对另一些人来说，它只是让他们的智力提升到比无意识稍微好一点。到底是怎样的东西赋予我们了智慧，似乎并没有什么规律可循。因为我们是刚刚才获得自我意识的，我们有很多需要去了解的东西。我们需要了解我们周围的世界，以及了解我们自己。

有一个问题不断浮现在我的脑海中。我们是从哪里来的？我们为什么存在？在地表之下有许多奇怪的生物，但我们却和它们有所不同。矮人种族与我们有相似之处，但他们有清晰的五官，而我们没有。也许我们是从同一个模子中铸造出来的，但是这个过程不知何故出错了？

我坚信，德瑞姆和矮人确实有共同的起源。但是，那是什么起源呢？这难道仅仅是因为多年来我们生活在不同环境所造成的变化吗？我整日思考这个问题，但是如果没有证据，我就没法证实我的猜想。我打算探索这些洞穴，直到找到一些线索和知识的碎片，引导我走向正确的研究方向。我需要知道真相。]], "_t")

t([[There were some cave-ins recently around the ruins. After it was safe to investigate, said cave-ins have revealed previously unexplored tunnels. Since I had not made much headway with my research, it was a welcome distraction.

To my delight, the tunnels showed signs of habitation! There were a number of primitive tools and weapons which showed little signs of decay. Mindless Drem are not known for making tools, so I came to the conclusion that this must have been a series of old dwarven tunnels. There were also some cave paintings of stout, bearded humanoids fighting off what appeared to be crude depictions of tentacled beasts.

This was not the only discovery we made too. There are multiple tunnels and there is evidence to suggest that they were carved out by hand. It is no secret that dwarves are expert miners, but to think that primitive dwarves could carve stone so easily... It is truly magnificent.

Multiple scouting parties were sent down the tunnels and it became obvious that all of the tunnels came from a single origin point. They lead into a single large cavity in the earth. The cavity itself has not been fully explored yet, but scouting parties have reported a number of strange ruins sighted within it. The physical description they gave me of the ruin does not match with any other civilisation we have documented...

It is a vague hope, but I hope in my heart of hearts that this place will finally give me the answers I have been seeking about the origin of Dwarves and Drem alike.]], [[废墟周围有些一些洞穴。在它们确认安全，可以调查之后，我们在这些洞穴中发现了以前未勘探的隧道。由于我的研究暂时没有取得很大进展，这是一个令人愉快的散心处。

让我高兴的是，这些隧道显示出曾经有人居住的迹象！这里面有许多原始的工具和武器，几乎没有风化的迹象。没有头脑的德瑞姆不知道制造工具，所以我得出的结论是，这一定是一系列古老的矮人隧道。在隧道里也有一些洞穴壁画，粗糙地描述着粗壮，长着胡须的人型生物与那些长着触手的野兽搏斗。

这并不是我们唯一的发现。这里有多条隧道，有证据表明，它们是手工凿出来的。矮人是矿工的行家，这一点并不是秘密，但原始的矮人可不能如此轻易地雕刻石头……它真的很壮观。

我们往隧道里派出了多只探险队。很明显，所有的隧道都通向一个统一的源头，那是一个地底下的巨大洞窟。我们还没能完全探索这个洞窟，但侦察队已经在里面找到了一些奇怪的遗骸。他们口中描述的废墟，从外表上看，与我们所记载的其他文明都不相符……

尽管这只是一个模糊的愿望，但我内心深处希望，这个地方会给我最终的答案，有关我一直在寻找的，矮人和德瑞姆的起源的答案。]], "_t")
t("our origins (3)", "我们的起源 (3)", "_t")
t([[The exploration of the cavity has been interesting, to say the least. At its very centre, we discovered a strange, egg-shaped structure. It's made out of some sort of metal which I have not seen before. Despite being covered in layers of ancient dust, the metal was untarnished and showed no noticeable signs of decay. It was highly resistant to damage, as our attempts to cut through it were met with failure, even when we employed magical means. There was a notable dent in its side, something which could have only been caused by a tremendous amount of force.

There was a passage way leading into the egg, which I volunteered to step through first. The inside of the egg was stranger still. There were dozens of metal tubes which covered the ceiling. Even as I stood there, I could hear the sound of some liquid pouring through them. The walls were covered in blinking lights and yet more metallic objects which I could not make sense of. It is obvious that the egg was some sort of massive machine. I cannot understand how it works or how it was made, though. There is no magic that I can sense, so this machine must rely entirely on mechanical means to function. No race that I know of has the knowledge to build such a thing. I could only imagine what sort of genius could design such a thing, let alone build it. 

Most interesting of all is that the egg has a thin layer of void energy over its entire surface. Us Drem are familiar with such energies, as we have dedicated much of our study to the otherworldly. The even spread of these energies suggests that this egg was completely bathed in them at some point. I do not know what circumstances could have lead to this, for such a concentration of these energies simply couldn't exist on Eyal. Not without causing a violent explosion, at least. We have done such experiments before.

Going deeper inside it, I began to notice that there were a number of glass pipes, wide enough for one of our party to fit in with room to spare. The metallic tubes above me fed into these pipes and pumped some sort of greenish liquid. I had planned to take a closer look, but it was then that we were set upon.

A number of things came crawling out from the dark. Us Drem are rather accustomed to sudden violence, so we tore into them before we could get a clear view of them. We sustained a few minor injuries, but the real shock came after we got a closer look at our attackers. They appeared to be some strange cross between dwarf, drem and something else, yet possessing a strangely child-like body. I imagine the jagged, razor sharp teeth aren't entirely natural either. We were not to be deterred, however. Surface folk may be shocked by such a creature, but we have seen far more sinister things down here.

We had to cut through dozens of them, maybe hundreds of them, in our journey through the egg. There was obviously a source of these things, and their vague resemblance to us spurned me to keep fighting. We eventually came to a chamber which I guessed was the centre of the egg. We found the source of our tormentors. Some great machine, which connected with dozens of glass tubes, appeared to have a malignant growth attached to it. The creatures were being spat out of broken tubes, rapidly growing to their full size and rushing toward us. Each creature varied from looking like a half formed dwarf, drem or some sort of bizarre, tentacled horror.

In the end, we eventually broke the pipes leading into the glass tubes and the creatures stopped coming out. That liquid must have been some sort of substance to nourish those creatures. Without that liquid, only feeble and half formed fetuses crawled out.

But that was only one machine that was making them. We ended up sealing off the chamber as best as we could, but we can hear more of them coming. One of the creatures latched onto my arm during the fight as well. It has infected me with some virulent disease, making my flesh wither away and turned into dried leather.

There is no misunderstanding our fate. We lost many Drem in the fight, and I am not the only one who has been infected with this disease. We are going to die in this room. But, I am content with this fate. I have worked out the truth of our origins.

We wandered into the back of the room where there were yet more tubes. To my surprise, these tubes contained fully formed bodies. A dwarf, complete with a long beard, floated inside the tube. He seemed to twitch like he was in the middle of a dream. As we went further and further down, we found yet more dwarves sleeping inside tubes. But, what we noticed was how with each dwarf, they continued to become more and more malformed. Eventually, we reached the final tube and we found a faceless dwarf inside. In other words, a Drem.

This egg has to be where we came from. This machine was built to create dwarves. I do not understand the process, but I have seen the outcome for myself. It is us Drem that are the anomaly, the dysfunctional byproduct of this machine's disrepair. Feral Drem must have emerged from this egg and ventured into the underground, where they then multiplied independently of the egg. These mutant fetuses must be the result of further disrepair and corruption, judging by the black growth which engulfs the machine in this room.

So, I know now. Even if this discovery never leaves this room, I can die content. Even if I am the product of a broken piece of machinery, I am happy that I had a chance to witness this moment. If you find these notes, please bring them back to my fellow Drem. I am sure they would be happy to know the truth too.]], [[可以说，对洞窟的探索很有意思。在它的中心，我们发现了一个奇怪的蛋形结构。它是由某种我以前没有见过的金属制成的。尽管蛋上覆盖着一层尘土，显示它的历史十分古老，金属却未没有破坏，也没有明显的生锈迹象。它对各种伤害有很高的抵抗力，即使我们使用魔法手段也没法刺穿它。它的侧面有明显的凹痕，考虑到它卓越的防御力，这个凹痕只有可能是由巨大的力量造成的。

在蛋的外部，有一条通往蛋形结构的通道，我自愿第一个踏入那里。蛋形结构的内部是否陌生。天花板上覆盖着几十根的金属管道，站在管道下，我能听到液体从管道中流过的声音。墙上覆盖着闪烁的灯光，还有更多我无法理解的金属物体。很明显，这个巨蛋是一种巨大的机器。不过，我既不知道它是如何工作的，也不知道它是怎么被制造出来的。我没有感觉到任何魔法的气息，所以这台机器一定是完全依靠机械手段来运作的。我所知道的任何种族都没有建立这样的东西的知识。我不知道到底是什么样的天才可以设计出这样的东西，更不知道谁有能力建造这样的庞然大物。

最有趣的是，巨蛋的整个表面都有覆盖着一层薄薄的虚空能量。我们德瑞姆熟悉这种能量，因为我们将大部分的精力都投入到了有关世界的外侧的研究。这些能量在巨蛋的外侧均匀散布，表明在某个时刻，这个蛋被这种能量完全沐浴了。我不知道在什么情况下可能会导致这种情况，因为这些能量根本不可能存在于埃亚尔集中出现，否则一定会引起剧烈的爆炸。我们之前做过这样的实验。

进一步深入它，我开始注意到有很多玻璃管，管径很宽，足够让我们的一个小队在里面行走。上方的金属管连入了这些管道，泵进了某种某种绿色液体。我们本来打算靠近仔细观察一下，但是那时我们突然被袭击了。

一些东西从黑暗中爬了出来。我们德瑞姆习惯于应对突如其来的暴力行为。因此，我们还没来得及看清楚袭击者的面容之前，就本能地把他们撕成了碎片。我们只遭受了轻微损伤，但在我们仔细观察了袭击者之后，我们深深被震惊了。它们似乎是矮人，德瑞姆或是其他生物之间的一种奇异的杂交，但却拥有一个奇怪的孩子般的身体。它们有着锯齿状的锋利的牙齿，显得十分不自然。地面上的人可能会被这样的生物震惊，然而，我们不会被吓倒，因为我们曾经见到过无数更加险恶的东西。

在我们在巨蛋中探索时，我们不得不打倒了几十个，乃至上百个这种怪物。显然，这里就是这些怪物的来源，这些怪物和我们在外貌上的相似性，让我们无心继续战斗。最终，我们来到了一个小房间，看来这里就是这个巨蛋的中心。我们找到了这些怪物的来源。那是一些巨大的机器，连接着几十根玻璃管子，有某种恶性的生长物附着在上面。破碎的管子不断吐出这些怪物，迅速成长成完整的大小，然后向我们冲来。这些怪物看起来像是半成型的矮人，德瑞姆，以及某种奇异的，长着触手的恐魔。

我们打破了通往玻璃管的管道，不再有怪物从里面出来了。那些液体肯定是滋养这些怪物的物质，失去了那种液体，里面跑出来的只有一些虚弱的、不成型的生命体。

但我们只是关闭了一台机器而已。我们尽可能地封闭了房间，但我们可以听到更多怪物袭来的声音。在激烈的战斗中，其中一个生物在我的手臂上咬了一口。它传染给了我一种致命的疾病，使我的肌肉萎缩，看起来如同晒干的皮革一般。

我们清楚地了解了自己的命运。我们在战斗中失去了很多同胞，其他人也都感染了这种可怕的疾病。我们即将在这个房间里死去。但是，我们面对着即将到来的死亡命运，却只感到充实和满足，因为我已经弄清了有关我们起源的真相。

我们徘徊到那些还有更多管子的房间里面。令我惊讶的是，管子里是完全成形的生命体。一只矮小的胡子长满了胡须，漂浮在管内。他的身体轻轻抽动，仿佛正在梦中。我们越走越远，发现更多矮人睡在管子中，也同时注意到，随着我们继续前进，那些矮人也变得越来越畸形。最终，我们到达了最后一个管子，我们发现里面有一个无脸的矮人——换句话说，一个德瑞姆。

这个巨蛋就是我们的起源。 这台机器是为了创造矮人而建造的。我并不了解这个制造的详细过程，但我已经明白了了结果。我们德瑞姆一族，是一种异常，是这台年久失修的机器功能失调的副产品。原生的德瑞姆一定是从这个巨蛋中出生的。他们离开创造自己的巨蛋独自生活，冒险进入地下，开始繁衍生息。 这些突变的胎儿，一定是这台机器因为年久失修而进一步退化的结果，正如我们在这些机器上看到的，吞噬着这些机器的黑色怪物一样。

所以，我现在知道了一切。即使我们的发现也许会永远留在这个房间里，我也可以死得其所。虽然我们是这台机器的故障的产物，但是我还是很高兴，有机会亲眼见证这一刻。如果你找到这些笔记，请把它们带回给我的德瑞姆同胞。我相信他们会很乐意知道真相。]], "_t")

t([[[i]I remember the devastation when I first made my journey to Elvala. Not a soul escaped the touch of the Spellblaze and no one could feel the pain and sorrow of the lands more than a thalore. I know that those back home still seethe with rage and anger as even now I still sometimes feel my emotions from that moment. It was a terrible day I wish I could forget but never will.[/i]

If I were to describe my years growing up in my birthplace, it would be summed up pretty easily as 'boring, uneventful, and repetitive'. I grew up in forests that no longer exist, collecting wood from fallen and dead trees while planting and cultivating new trees to grow. The wood I collected was stored in a large stockpile behind my house and used to fashion staves or bows by other skilled thaloren who lived nearby for sale abroad. The proceeds from our exports were used to buy items we couldn't readily find in our forests or in the lands of the humans or halflings nearby.

That all changed one day when the skies changed to a color of deep purple and above me the tops of all the trees I tended began to burst into a cacophony of sickening colors. Below me the earth began to shake to its very foundation and the ground I stood on tore apart causing trees to uproot and come crashing down. Perhaps worst of all though was the air that howled around me, a spreading dark wind that swept through the trees in a wave of sickness that perverted the lands and caused everything to decay. By sheer luck I somehow survived the devastation, I'm not entirely sure how, but many of my fellow thaloren who were with me did not.

Gone was the home which I lived in, and the wood that I had collected. Gone were the trees that I planted or had stood for generations before. All that was left around me was the dead husks of trees and the ruined settlement I grew up in, as well as some of the rotting and misshapen corpses of those I once knew. I joined together with those that survived to rescue who we could, but many succumbed to their injuries both before and after we found them. It was when we began to bury the corpses that I remember hearing the cries of anguish for the loss of loved ones, not to mention the destruction of nature all around us.

Eventually soldiers came for us and we were led towards the capital for shelter from the polluted lands that was once our home. Reaching the city I was greeted with a truly chaotic display as refugees streamed in from other settlements, the wounded lined the streets, and seemingly everyone else was in open hysteria. I was a bit perplexed at first, wondering why the wounded weren't being tended to or the refugees being housed. It wasn't long before I learned the reason for the maddening sounds spewing from their lungs, this catastrophe being a result of shaloren mages. I can still feel the tense unthinking rage I felt even now as I recall it.

It was at that point I decided that I would visit the Shaloren lands. I felt at the time that I had made this decision of my own volition, to enact retribution against the shaloren, though now I don't know if that was truly the case. Regardless of my reasoning, I made my way back to my home to collect whatever I could find in the rubble, and the next day I left the borders of the forest. For the next several days I crossed through blackened and blasted lands, finding little to eat or drink. Travel was slow as a result of debris being scattered across the land, not to mention the difficulty it took scavenging for food. I was starving when I spotted a small settlement that had escaped the destruction.

I entered the first inn I came across and quickly purchased some food. As I consumed my meal I overheard a couple patrons arguing about the recent events. A human voice yelled "Even the orcs couldn't have brought this sort of devastation!" Turning my head to listen I soon heard a halfling retort "You say that but the orcs would have soon reached these lands and you would be too dead to care." "Yea, well now thanks to those accursed mages an unimaginable number of people are dead. DEAD!" "The orcs killed more, and they left no one alive. You at least still have some friends and loved ones who survived, all those who I once knew are dead. DEAD!"

Silence permeated the air between the two. I could feel the rage within the human, much like I could feel my own, but he soon got up and left. I wish I could say that I had done the same but unfortunately I cannot. When the halfling proceeded to begin gather his belongings and leave I followed him out of the establishment. Seemingly aware of this I was confronted outside. Heated words were exchanged between us, then shouting. I don't entirely recall as to what happened next but I do remember looking at my bloody hand as the halfling lay dead on the ground. Becoming aware of what I had done I quickly fled from the settlement.

Over the next two days I didn't eat or sleep. I crossed through several now dead settlements, seemingly abandoned by whoever survived. I couldn't stop thinking about the halfling that I had killed, and though the shaloren still remained the focus of my anger I began to question what I was doing. I soon had more questions to think about as I came upon a recent battlefield. Charred corpses of what I assumed to be orcs lay scattered on the ground, and there was innumerable amounts of them. Across from their corpses I soon saw the corpses of shaloren soldiers, and this puzzled me greatly.

What anger I had felt towards the shaloren now turned to confusion. By what madness were they dead? Were they sacrificed to kill the orcs? Did they willingly do it of their own accord? Were the shaloren really to blame? I couldn't fathom an answer to any of the questions racing through my mind as I wondered what I should do. Eventually I continued onward and found the outskirts of a Shaloren settlement. Through the collapsed buildings I could see wolves feasting on the remains of corpses, which I assumed to be its residents. I also heard a voice cry for help in the distance.

Making my way towards where the voice was coming from I saw a male shalore surrounded by a group of hungry wolves. A couple of the wolves looked in my direction, and swiftly made their way towards me. Having dealt with rogue animals in the past I quickly dodged as the first one lunged towards me and struck a blow against it, causing it to stumble back a bit. The second one came around to attack me from the side, clamping down on my left arm. With a firm thrust I slammed it against the ruined side of a building, causing it to give a big yelp and let go. Realizing I was not to be trifled with the wolves scampered off quickly.

Giving notice to the two wolves fleeing, the other wolves soon turned tail as well. I sat down to examine the injury I had received. Despite what looked to be a fairly painful wound, I remember feeling little to no pain from it. I soon pulled out an infusion that I had brought with me and began to treat the gash left from the creature’s teeth. While doing this I heard a voice call out from behind me. Realizing the shalore was still here, I turned around as he approached. As he drew closer and looked towards my face the shalore immediately stopped and gave a blank face.

A bit perplexed by this I sat there looking confused. For a moment we stared at each other in silence before the shalore finally exclaimed "You're a thalore." I blinked a couple of times at this before I replied yes. Seemingly in shock for a brief moment before finally coming to his senses, I was soon asked what I was doing here. Upon hearing that question, I wondered what I should answer. I then realized I no longer knew the answer to why I had come here, as the anger that had driven me to come had mostly dissipated. After a while I finally gave an answer. "I've come to find out why." ]], [[[i]我还记得我第一次前往埃尔瓦拉旅行时所见证的灾难。没有一个灵魂能逃过魔法大爆炸的侵袭，也没有人能比自然精灵更能感受到这片土地的痛苦和悲伤。我知道那些留在家里的人仍然怒火中烧，即使是现在，我仍然有时能感受到我那一刻的情绪。这是一个可怕的日子，我希望我能忘记这一天，但我永远做不到。[/i]

如果我描述我在出生地长大的岁月，可以很简单总结为“无聊、平淡、重复”。我生长一片现在已经不再存在的森林里，从倒栽树和枯树上采集木材，同时种植和培育新树来生长。我收集的木材储存在我家后面的一个大仓库里，用来给其他住在附近的技术娴熟的自然精灵，制作用来销往国外的木棍或弓箭。我们出口的收入，被用来购买我们在森林或附近人类或半身人的土地上找不到的东西。
	
有一天，当天空变成深紫色的时候，一切都变了。在我的头顶上，我所照料的所有树木开始发出刺耳的颜色。在我脚下，大地的根基在动摇，撕开我脚下的地面，将树木连根拔起。最糟糕的是我周围呼啸的空气，那是一股蔓延的黑风，在疾病的浪潮中席卷树木，使大地扭曲，让万物腐烂。仅仅是出于幸运，我在灾难中侥幸幸免于难，我不完全确定我是怎么做到的，但我身边的许多自然精灵同胞没能挺过去。
	
我住的房子和收集的木头都被摧毁了。我所种的树，或是我几代人所立的树，都化为了一片焦土。我周围只剩下枯死的树的外壳，以及化为废墟的家乡，还有一些我曾经认识的那些同伴腐烂和畸形的尸体。我和那些幸存下来的人一起前去营救我们能救的人，但是很多人在我们找到他们之前，或者之后的过程中，都死于了这场灾难的伤害。当我们开始埋葬尸体的时候，我所听到的那些为失去亲人而发出的痛苦的呼喊，深深地刻印在我的记忆之中，更不用说我们周围的大自然所遭受的毁灭了。
	
最后，一群士兵们找到了我们，我们被带到首都，躲避曾经是我们家园的污染土地。我来到这座城市时，看到了一幅真正混乱的画面，难民从他们各自的家乡涌入这里，伤员排在街道两旁，每个人都在这种情况下陷入了疯狂。一开始我有点困惑，不明白为什么伤员没有得到照顾，难民也没有得到安置。不久，我就知道了为什么：那些人发出声嘶力竭的呐喊，告诉我们这场灾难是永恒精灵法师造成的。直到现在回想起来，我仍能感受到当时我的那种急切的、不假思索的愤怒。
	
就在那时，我决定前往永恒精灵的土地。我当时觉得，我是自愿做出这个决定的，要对永恒精灵实施报复，不过现在我不知道这是否是真的。不管我的理由如何，我回到家里收集我在瓦砾中找到的东西，第二天我离开了森林的边界。在接下来的几天里，我穿过了黑暗焦灼的土地，几乎找不到吃的和喝的。由于散落在大地上的碎片，旅行十分缓慢，更不用说获得食物是多么困难了。当我看到一个逃过毁灭的小定居点时，我已经饿坏了。
	
我进了我遇到的第一家旅馆，很快就买了些食物。当我吃完饭时，我无意中听到几个顾客在争论最近发生的事情。一个人类高声喊道：“即使是兽人也不可能带来这种毁灭！”我转过头去听，很快听到一个半身人反驳道：“你说的对，但是兽人很快就会到达这些地方，你会死得毫无价值。”“是的，好吧，现在多亏了那些被诅咒的法师，不计其数的人都死了。死了！”“兽人杀的更多，他们不会留下任何一个活口。你至少还有一些朋友和亲人幸存下来，而我曾经认识的人全都死了。死了！”
	
空气中弥漫着寂静。我能感觉到人类内心的愤怒，就像我能感觉到自己的愤怒一样，但他很快就起身离开了。我希望我可以说我也做了同样的事，但不幸的是，我不能。当那半身人开始收拾他的东西离开时，我跟着他走出了那个定居点。他似乎意识到我跟随了他，我们面对面对峙了起来。我们之间激烈地争吵，然后开始大喊大叫。我不完全记得接下来发生了什么，但我确实记得，那一刻，当我看着我沾满鲜血的双手，以及倒在地上死去的半身人的尸体的时候，我意识到了我所做的一切，很快逃离了定居点。
	
在接下来的两天里，我仍然不眠不休。我穿过了几个已经废弃的定居点，似乎被那些幸存的人遗弃了。我一直在想我杀的那个半身人，虽然永恒精灵仍然是我愤怒的焦点，但我开始怀疑，我到底在做什么。当我来到最近的战场时，我很快就有了更多的问题要思考。兽人烧焦的尸体散落在地上，数量不计其数。但在他们尸体的对面，我很快就看到了永恒精灵士兵的尸体，这让我非常困惑。
	
我对永恒精灵的愤怒现在变成了困惑。他们是怎么死的？他们是为了杀死兽人而牺牲的吗？他们是自愿这样做的吗？永恒精灵真的是一切的罪魁祸首吗？我仔细思考我该怎么做，但我想不出任何问题的答案。最后，我继续往前走，找到了永恒精灵定居点的郊区。透过倒塌的建筑物，我可以看到野狼在享用当地居民尸体的残骸。我还听到远处传来了呼救声。
	
我朝声音传来的地方走去，看见一位男性永恒精灵被一群饥饿的狼包围着。几只狼朝我的方向看了看，迅速向我扑来。因为我过去有着长期和野生动物打交道的经验，我很快躲开了第一只狼的猛冲，重击了一下，使它绊倒在地。第二只狼从侧面扑向我，咬在我的左臂上。我使劲一推，猛地把它撞在一间房屋的废墟上，它大叫一声，然后就松开了。意识到我是一个不容小觑的敌人，两只狼飞快地跑掉了。
	
其他的狼注意到两只狼逃跑了，很快也夹着尾巴逃跑了。我坐下来，检查我受的伤势。尽管伤口看起来十分严重，但我记得那时的我几乎感觉不到疼痛。我很快拿出随身携带的纹身，开始治疗这只狼的尖牙留下的伤口。做这件事的时候，我听到身后传来一个声音，我意识到那个永恒精灵还在这里。当他走近我，朝我的脸望去时，我转过身来盯着他，永恒精灵立刻停了下来，露出茫然的表情。
	
与他的困惑相同，我同样用困惑的表情看着他。我们沉默地盯着对方看了一会儿，终于，那个永恒精灵喊了一声：“你是自然精灵。”我眨了几下眼睛，回答说，我是的。他似乎十分震惊，停顿了片刻，然后终于恢复了他的表情，询问我来这里做什么。听到这个问题，我不知道该怎么回答。然后，我意识到，我已经不再知道我为什么要来这里，因为曾经驱使我来这里的愤怒已经慢慢消散了。过了一会儿，我终于回答了：“我是来寻找这一切的原因的。”]], "_t")

t([[[i]I've never really understood why people so readily gave their names. Among the thaloren I scarcely knew the names of anyone, save for that of family or those considered as such. I remember a dwarf merchant that once visited my homeplace. He seemed to think that whatever title he held meant something. Really names mean nothing, and I could deal with a human or halfling merchant the same as that dwarf. I don't need to know your name to deal with you.[/i]

For another brief moment there was silence. In his mind he seemed to mull over the meaning of what he said, but seemingly understood what I was after. As he took a moment to think as I glanced him over. Both the shalore's face and clothing was quite rugged and I noticed a quiver along with a dagger at his side. I would have figured him for a hunter but the way he spoke seemed too disciplined for it. He probably was of a military background, most likely a scout for the shaloren military. I also noticed the blood streaming down his arm from an untreated wound.

"You should treat that" I stated. Glancing towards his arm the man merely grunted "I'll bandage it soon enough.” Why he said 'bandage it' confused me, but before I had time to ask about it he soon stated "Come, it's dangerous here with the animals." Moving past me he preceded to begin walking southwards. I was motioned to follow, and hearing a wolf howl in the distance I decided it would probably be best to do so. We made our way out and away from the buildings. While a couple of animals caught notice of us, they simply just watched as as we made our way out of the settlement.

For a couple of hours we walked down a weathered road. Along the way the man introduced himself. He gave his name as the other races seem to commonly do, and stated he was a ranger that had been dispatched to find any shaloren that had been left outside the walls of their capital city. Unfortunately while gathering people to leave the wolves attacked and killed everyone in the settlement where I had encounter him. He'd lost his bow when I had come along and was the only one still alive, the rest of the shaloren he had come to rescue were eaten by the wolves. Somberly we continued onward from that point in silence. It was another hour before we walked towards an active campsite ahead.

As we approached a couple of cloaked figures stepped out from behind us. With swords in hand, a few more approached us from in front. They seemed to pause and look in my direction for a moment. A final figure soon stepped forwards, another shaloren man, and seemingly the leader of the group. Hoarsely the leader stated "Where are the residents?" "Dead, food for the wolves.” the scout replied "Same would have been for me." The leader soon glanced in my direction before stating "I'm guessing this one is involved with you coming back then. Come, let's go talk in the camp."

The leader turned to walk away. Once again the scout motioned for me to follow, and we made our way towards a simmering fire. A ragged bunch of shaloren sat around it while a shalore in a heavy cloak like the other men stood guard with a bow in hand. Nearby a couple more shaloren lay in what looked to be a hastily constructed lean-to. Red stains dotted bandages covering injuries on their bodies. The leader walked over to a chest nearby, pulling out a bow and some fresh bandages and handed them to the scout. The look of confusion soon crossed my face again, of which the leader seemed to catch notice.

The leader asked "Something wrong thalore?" Deciding to finally get some answers as to why they weren't using infusions I soon responded "What's with the bandages, do you not have any infusions?" Seemingly amused by this the leader retorted "A shalore use infusions?" The leader seemed to smile as if some joke had been told. I could hear some of the cloaked figures chuckling in the background. Proceeding to talk the leader continued "While I understand that you might make use of infusions, we seek to strive above such things by our nature."

I was a bit baffled by this response. Hearing a cough from one of the nearby wounded shalore though I politely stated "Even if you might die as a result of not using them?" To this the leaders face took a more solemn look as he looked towards the shaloren under the lean-to. Looking back towards me the leader quietly responded "Of course not." As I looked towards the shalore I directly stated in a firm voice "Then why are those shaloren laying wounded there?" To this the response was quietly given "Because a shalore does not carry infusions with them."

How stupid I thought. I'd heard of the halflings being proud but even they weren't this foolhardy. Reaching into my pack I pulled out some infusions and held them out in my hand. Seemingly all the shaloren looked down with some odd contempt at the infusions in my hand, but they said nothing. Finally from behind the scout stated "Enough have died, with their wounds those two might not live the night." Immediately I could see the discomfort cross the leader’s face, but he merely closed his eyes and stated "If you wish to treat them, thalore, do as you will."

I was awestruck at this, this indifferent tone, but I held my tongue as I heard more coughing from the wounded shalore. Deciding what's best for now would be to treat the wounded shaloren I simply walked over to the lean-to. In no time at all I removed the bandages and began to treat their wounds. Quickly the gaps in their skin closed and their bodies began to mend as I used my infusions. While not fully healed as my infusions were used up, the two I treated looked far better off then they were before.

Reaching into my pack to pull out some more infusions to finish my job I heard the leaders voice call out "That's enough." Snapping my head back in amazement I held my tongue no longer saying "Did you not wish for me to treat them?" Diplomatically I received the reply "They don't look like they are going to die anymore now do they? Those infusions you have, they are a finite resource. Maybe you should save them for those who are nearer to death." Calming down a bit I wondered what the shalore was getting at. So I asked the question "What do you mean, save them for who?"]], [[[i]我真的不明白，为什么人们这么容易说出自己的名字。在自然精灵中，我几乎不知道任何人的名字，除了家人或那些被我看做和家人一样重要的人的名字。我记得一个矮人商人曾经来过我的家乡，他似乎认为他所拥有的一切头衔都是有意义的。但对我来说，真名没什么意义，我可以和任何一个人类或半身人商人做生意，这与那位矮人做生意没有什么区别。我不需要知道你的名字也能和你交流。

又是一个寂静无声的短暂片刻。他看起来正在思考如何回答，但似乎明白我在追求什么。在他思考的时候，我打量着他的外貌。那个永恒精灵的脸和衣服都很粗糙，我注意到他身边有一个箭袋和一把匕首。我本以为他是个猎人，但他说话的方式似乎有着很强的纪律性。他可能有军事背景，很可能是永恒精灵军队的侦察兵。我还注意到鲜血从他手臂上未经处理的伤口上流下。

我说：“你应该赶紧处理它。”。那人瞥了一眼他的胳膊，只是咕哝着说：“我很快就包扎好。”他说的主句“包扎好”使我感到困惑，但我还没来得及问起，他很快就说：“跟我走吧，这里的动物很危险。”他从我身边走过，开始往南走，示意我跟着。听到远处的狼嚎声，我决定最好还是跟着他。我们离开了废弃的楼房。有一些动物注意到了我们，但他们只是看着我们离开这片定居点。

我们在一条饱经风霜的路上走了几个小时。一路上，那人做了自我介绍。他说出了自己的名字，就像其他种族通常所做的那样。他说自己是一名游侠，被派去寻找任何留在首都城墙外的永恒精灵。不幸的是，当他聚集人们离开时，狼群袭来并杀死了那座定居点里的所有人。在我来的时候，他把弓弄丢了，他是唯一还活着的人，他来救的其他永恒精灵都被狼吃掉了。在听到他的故事之后，我们因为忧郁继续沉默下去。又走了一个小时，一座活跃的营地出现在我们的面前。

当我们走近时，从我们身后走出了几个穿着斗篷的人，手里拿着长剑。又有几个人从前面向我们走来，他们停下来朝我的方向看了一会儿。最后一个人很快走了过来，这位永恒精灵似乎是这个组织的领袖。那位领袖声音嘶哑地说：“居民在哪里？”“死了，成了狼的食物。”侦察兵回答说，“我本来也会死的。”首领朝我的方向瞥了一眼，然后说：“我想，这个人和你能够平安回来有关。来吧，我们去营地谈谈。”

领袖转身走开了。侦察兵再次示意我跟着他，我们朝着一团熊熊燃烧的火堆走去。一帮衣衫褴褛的自然精灵围着它坐着，一个和其他人一样披着厚斗篷的自然精灵，手拿弓站着旁边守卫。在附近，又有几个永恒精灵躺在一个看起来是匆忙建造的斜坡上。他们身上布满了红色污渍的绷带。领袖走到附近的一个箱子旁，掏出一个弓和一些新绷带递给侦察兵。我脸上很快又出现了困惑的表情，那位领袖似乎注意到了这一点。

领袖问：“自然精灵，你有什么问题吗？”最终，我决定得到有关于他们为什么不使用纹身的答案，很快我就回答说：“为什么使用绷带，你们没有纹身吗？”领袖似乎对此很感兴趣，反驳道：“应该用纹身吗？”他笑了起来，好像我讲了什么笑话似的。我能听到一些穿着斗篷的人在背后咯咯笑。领袖接着说：“虽然我知道，你们可能会用纹身，但我们的天性想要超越这种东西。”

我对这个反应感到困惑。听到附近受伤的永恒精灵发出的咳嗽，我克制住自己，礼貌地说：“即使你马上就要死了，你也决定不用它吗？”听到这句话，领袖的脸上展露出凝重的神情，低头看了看那个永恒精灵。回过头来，领队平静地回答说：“当然不会。”我看向那位永恒精灵，用坚定的语调继续说：“那么，为什么要放着那些受伤的永恒精灵不管？”听到这句话，他平静地给出了回应，“因为永恒精灵不会把纹身带在身边。”

真是一群愚蠢的家伙。我知道半身人是一群骄傲著称的家伙，但是即使是他们也不会这样鲁莽。我把手伸进背包里，拿出了几件纹身，交到了他们的手中。那些永恒精灵看向我手中纹身的表情似乎包含了某种奇怪的鄙夷，但他们一句话也没有收到。最后，我身后的那位侦查兵发话了：“已经死了够多人了，如果他们的伤口还不得到治疗，那两个人也没法活过今天。”我看到领袖脸上立刻浮现出不适的表情，但他闭上了眼睛，说道：“自然精灵，如果你希望治疗他们的话，请便吧。”

我被这样冷漠的语气吓了一跳，但听着那位受伤的永恒精灵的咳嗽声，最终紧闭了嘴唇。我知道，现在最应该做的就是治疗那个受伤的永恒精灵，于是我径直走向前去。我迅速拆掉了绷带，使用纹身治疗他们的伤口，他们皮肤上的伤痕很快就愈合了。当我的纹身用完之后，尽管他们还没有被完全治愈，但是他们的状况比起以前已经好了很多。

我把手伸进包里，想要拿出更多的纹身来完成我的工作，但领袖的声音传来，“够了。”我惊讶地把头向后转去，控制不住说道：“难道，你不希望我治疗他们吗？”我收到了圆滑的答复：“他们看起来已经脱离生命危险了，不是吗？你的纹身是有限的，也许你应该把它们留给那些更加生命垂危的人。”我冷静下来，想要知道那些永恒精灵到底在干什么。所以，我径直问道：“这是什么意思，你们要把这些纹身留给谁？”]], "_t")

t([[[i]While the shaloren are no longer as lost as they seemingly were when I first entered Elvala, I can still see the searching expressions on their faces even now as I write this. It is as if they feel a similar loss to whatever it is they are connected to in the same way the thalore feel the devastation of nature. I do not know what connection the arcane and nature have, but I know it is shared relationship, and strain on one will result in strain on the other. [/i]

Aware of the suffering of the other shaloren, it was soon explained to me that there were other groups of rangers relocating refugees from the other settlements to their capital. I can't say I had any interest in helping the other shaloren, and personally felt that I was simply being dissuaded from using my infusions anymore than I had to on the casualties I had just treated. However, the scout being aware of my intentions helped to broker a deal - if I help the rangers in their duties of rescuing as many of the shaloren as possible, they would help me get the answers I sought.

To these terms I agreed, and over the next couple of days I traveled with the rangers as they rounded up what people they could. On the third day we began to journey towards the south through a dense forest. As we cleared the forest boundaries an unnatural misty smoke swirled in the distance. I was told that beyond the smoke lay Elvala, which I would come to learn was the name of their capital. Traveling for a couple of minutes, we came to a spot near a small lake. All at once, a tunnel opened up, seemingly inviting us inside.

It was terribly disorienting within the tunnel. The sounds of dust and wind seemed to scream a terrible discord. I think I also saw the corpses of humans deep within the smoke for some reason as we made our way through to the other side. As the city came into view, I was soon greeted by a bleak view. As I walked through the streets with the rangers, all I could see was blank expressions on the other shaloren faces. Seemingly they all wandered here and there as if in some sort of haze. A strange sense of panic seemed to course through every shalore that I passed, as if they had lost something dear to them.

Having come here initially to seek retribution on them, I wondered if I would still do so after seeing the people here like this. The shaloren were a broken people, and while those responsible had committed a vile atrocity against Eyal, those I saw here seemingly endured a harsh punishment in response. I could still feel a deep anger at the time, but them living as they did now seemed to be a satisfactory punishment, and any hostile feelings I felt towards them was almost mollified. They had seemingly paid for their crime in full.

The refugees we had brought were soon escorted to an open lot in the center of the city, where hastily constructed tents had been set up. Some refugees appeared to be in mourning, while others seemingly attempted to remain ahold of their sanity. As the last of the refugees left us, a shalore in white robes approached us. From within his robes I caught eye of some infusions. Finally I thought, a shalore with common sense enough to carry some infusions. We were soon asked if there were any injured among us, to which the leader of the rangers shook his head.

Somewhat disbelieving of this, the healer pressed for answers. A hand was waved in my direction, the healer quickly glanced towards me. Blinking for a moment the healer gave the same dumbfounded expression that the scout had given me before. "Yes I'm a thalore" I sternly stated. "Oh, ah, yes" the healer stuttered back. As the healer regained his senses the ranger took the healers ear and whispered to it. The eyes seemed to raise on the healer for a moment, before a quick "yes" seemed to part his lips. "Ahh, thalore, would you follow me then please."

As the healer began to walk away I looked to the leader of the rangers one more time. Looking back to me he replied "The doctor will take you to the main healing grounds. Don't worry, I haven't forgotten our bargain with you. I will try to get you an audience with someone who can give you the answers you seek." I got the sense that he was looking to milk my services for all he could at this point and coldly replied back "You best not test my patience too long." Seemingly smiling to this, he nodded towards the waiting healer, and slowly began to turn to head off.

We soon headed over a muddy field, dodging the tents of refugees that had been raised everywhere. Eventually we came to a tall building, inside of which many shaloren lay wounded on beds, and some too on the floor. Making our way to the back of the building, we entered what I assumed to be the healer's office. "You wouldn't happen to know the basics of mixing infusions would you?" I was soon asked. "I know how to mix basic numbing and regenerative infusions.” I replied. Nodding to this, the healer pulled out a paper and began to write down on it.

As the healer finished writing he handed the paper to me "The shalore and thalore are near identical in biology when it comes to infusions, so anything that you could use on yourself will work on a shalore. Here is a list of the infusion ingredients we have available. I'll lead you to our workshop where you can get to work making some." The healer rose to get up, grabbing a key from a shelf. Moving towards the door I was led down to the basement where the infusion workshop was. Unlocking the door, the healer handed me the key, and led me inside.]], [[[i]虽然那些永恒精灵不再像我刚进入埃尔瓦拉的时候那样迷惑了，但在我写下这些的时候，我仍然能够看到他们脸上困惑的表情。似乎，和我们自然精灵在大自然遭受浩劫时感受到的痛苦一样，他们也感受到着同样的痛苦。我并不知道奥术力量和自然之间有什么关系，但是我知道，他们之间有着一种共通的关系，在其中一样上的压力也会导致另一者的压力。[/i]

意识到另一位永恒精灵的痛苦，他们很快就向我解释说，还有其他一些游侠正在将难民从其他定居点转移到首都。我不能说我对帮助其他永恒精灵有任何兴趣，我个人觉得我只是被劝阻不要再使用我的纹身，就在我刚刚治疗了一个伤者之后。然而，那位侦察兵意识到我的关注，也许有助于促成一笔交易——如果我帮助游侠尽可能多地营救永恒精灵，他们也许会帮助我得到我想要的答案。

我同意了这些条件，在接下来的几天里，我和游侠们一起四处寻找他们能找到的人。第三天，我们开始穿过茂密的森林向南旅行。当我们穿过森林边界时，一股不自然的雾状浓烟在远处盘旋。有人告诉我，在浓雾的另一边就是埃尔瓦拉，我后来这是他们首都的名字。旅行了几分钟，我们来到一个小湖附近的地方。突然，一条隧道打开了，似乎在邀请我们进去。

在隧道里，我完全迷失了方向。沙尘和风的声音似乎在我们的周围发出不协调的尖啸。我也看到了，在烟雾中静静躺着一些人类尸体，恐怕是被人杀死的。当这座城市映入眼帘时，我很快就看到了一片荒凉的景色。当我和游侠走在街上时，我只看到其他自然精灵的脸上一片空白。似乎他们都在四处游荡，仿佛置身于某种阴霾之中。在我见到的每一位永恒精灵的脸上，都有一种奇怪的恐慌感，我能看出，他们失去了一些对他们来说很珍贵的东西。

尽管我来这里是为了向他们寻求复仇，但看到这里的民众，我不知道我是否还会这样做。永恒精灵成为了一个破碎的民族，尽管他们的罪魁祸首对埃亚尔犯下了卑劣的暴行，但我在这里见到的那些人只受到了严厉的惩罚。直到当时，我仍然能够感受到深深的愤怒，但他们现在的遭遇已经是过于严苛的惩罚，我对他们的任何敌对情绪都几乎都被平息了。他们似乎已经为自己的罪行付出了全部的代价。

我们带来的难民很快就被护送到市中心的一块空地上，那里匆忙搭建了帐篷。一些难民似乎在哀悼，而另一些似乎试图保持他们的理智。当最后一批难民离开我们时，一个身穿白色长袍的永恒精灵走近我们。我从他的长袍里看到了一些纹身。终于，我想，看来有常识的永恒精灵也是会使用纹身的。很快有人问我们是否有人受伤，游侠队长摇了摇头。

那位治疗师有些不相信这一点，继续追问答案。游侠队长一只手朝我的方向挥了挥，治疗师迅速朝我瞥了一眼，眨了眨眼，表情和侦察兵以前给我的一模一样。“是的，我是一个自然精灵，”我严肃地说“哦，啊，是的。”治疗师结结巴巴地说。侦察兵走到治疗师的身边，耳语了几句，治疗师的眼睛似乎抬起了一会儿，然后轻轻说了一句“是”。接着，他向我说道：“是的，自然精灵，请跟我来。”

当治疗师准备走开时，我又看了一眼游侠队长。他回头对我说：“治疗师会带你去主要的疗伤场所。别担心，我没有忘记我们和你的交易。我会试着让你认识一个能帮助你寻求答案的人。”我感觉到他正在尽他所能地让我帮他们干活，于是冷冷地回答道：“你最好不要考验我太久的耐心。”他微笑着没有回答，朝着等待治疗的人点了点头，然后慢慢地转过头去。

我们很快就穿过一片泥泞的田野，躲过了到处都是难民的帐篷。最后，我们来到了一座高楼，里面有许多永恒精灵伤者躺在床上，有些也躺在地板上。我们走到建筑物后面，走进了我以为是治疗室的地方。“你不会还知道混合纹身的基本原理吧？”他们很快就这样问我。“我知道如何混合基本的麻木纹身和再生纹身。”治疗师点点头，拿出一张纸，开始写下来。

当治疗师写完后，他把那张纸交给我，“当涉及到纹身时，永恒精灵和自然精灵的身体结构几乎是一样的，所以，任何你可以用在自己身上的东西，都可以用在永恒精灵身上。这是我们提供的纹身材料清单。“我带你去我们的工作间，在那里你可以制作一些纹身。”治疗师站起身来，从架子上拿了一把钥匙。我向门口走去，被带到纹身工作间所在的地下室。治疗师打开门，把钥匙递给我，带我进去。]], "_t")

t([[[i]It still strikes me how adverse the shaloren are to infusions. Seemingly they would rather tempt fate and avoid using them. One of the purposes of infusions is to restore one to good health after suffering an injury, but for a shalore it was more a means of last resort to avoid dying. What's more, they seem to fail to understand that holding off on infusion use simply results in them using infusions more in the long run, as beyond just mending their flesh they will have to stave off infection from their open wounds as well.[/i]

Over the next few days I mixed and created several infusions for use by the shaloren. The workshop contained all the amenities for sleeping, and the healer would often bring basic food staples and drink to me. Well, I should say to the shalore it may have been basic food and drink, but by thalore standards I was treated pretty lavishly. I mean, I know the dwarves treat alcohol as a staple good for consumption but apparently so did the shaloren with the amount of wine I was given. Anyhow, how I was treated was quite better then I would have expected to be sure.

Around the fourth day, after having created a great number of infusions, I was asked to come up to help apply them. Many of those I treated were near death, riddled by festering infections brought about from simply bandaging their wounds and nothing else. Similar to how I had treated the wounded shaloren in that lean-to, I only used the infusions as much as possible to get them off of death's door. This wasn't really due to having a lack of infusions but more so as a result of the stubborn mindset shaloren seemed to have in regards to infusions for some reason.

It was about a week later when most of the refugees had been treated that word had arrived of a detachment of shaloren soldiers that had returned from their battles with the orcs. Apparently they had been fighting on the eastern side of the continent along with the Human Kingdoms of the East when the Spellblaze occurred. The scarce few that were still alive after had traveled back to Elvala, but had been stalled as a result of being unable to travel directly through the middle of the continent. Of those that had survived, only a couple hundred had managed to make it back alive.

By this point I had at least some sympathy for those I treated, what after having tended to hundreds of them. But what caught my attention more was what they had said about having been unable to travel directly to Elvala. In the middle of the continent the Midvale Plains were located, a large flat land from which one could literally see just an open field. From my basic knowledge of the continent, the plains were completely open and easily traversable. Unless there was some huge orcish army that had survived and blocked their path, there would have been no need to move northwards around this area.

I didn't have long to ponder my thoughts before one of the assistant healers approached, and handed a bunch of strange tablets in a leather pouch to me. Pulling one of them out I noticed a glowing insignia inscribed on it, which seemed to course with the powers of the arcane. As I turned to ask what these were for, I found only an empty space as the healer had moved on to tend to the soldiers that were entering the building. Perplexed and befuddled as to what I should do with the strange tablets, a nearby tap on my shoulder brought my attention to one of the soldiers. A hand soon reached over and took one of the strange tablets from the pouch.

Turning to see what the soldier was up to, I noticed the huge gashes through the blackened armor he wore. For a moment I stuttered a bit as my hands were full holding the runes and unable to grab any infusions, but then I noticed something peculiar. Amazingly the insignia on the tablet seemed to shimmer and shift, before somehow merging with the soldier's hand. A light blue glow seemed to take a hold of the soldiers eyes as a strange energy seemingly coursed through his body. What occurred next truly caught me off guard as the soldier eventually began to murmur some words, and his deep gaping wounds began to close on their own.

Completely at a loss for what was occurring, the soldier seemed to be healing himself in front of me. As the moment passed the light blue glow left his eyes and they returned to their normal color, his wounds not just healed but showing absolutely no sign of an injury even having existed. It was my first time ever witnessing the use of runes or the use of healing spells. I'd heard of spell use before but I’d never known that runes had even existed at that point in my life. I soon learned the tablets I had been given were called manasurge runes, and that they enabled the restoration of mana lines within a person.

I don't know much about the arcane even now or how it works, but apparently something about the Spellblaze had permanently altered the workings of magic from that point in the world, and while with training it was still possible to call on the powers of magic, it was much more difficult than before. Other wounded soldiers would come after the first and much in the same way they would take the manasurge runes, gain the glowing insignias on their hands, or arms, or legs, really any body part that they wish, and then proceed to cast spells, promptly healing themselves or sometimes other soldiers.

After a while the number of wounded soldiers began to dwindle as most of them didn't require rest after healing themselves. When their numbers began to reach more manageable amounts, the chief healer approached to thank me on behalf of the Shaloren for my efforts. Suddenly remembering the entire reason I had come here to begin with, I noted that I had been fulfilling my end of the bargain. Nodding to this the chief healer looked behind me as a soldier approached and responded "The lieutenant will escort you to the general." I was taken aback by this somewhat but assumed this general held the answers as to the events that had taken place.

The soldier led me to the center of the city where a grand building lay. After meeting with a couple of the guards clad head to toe in shiny plate armor, we were let in. It took several minutes walking through the building’s halls, seemingly walking the building’s entire length to the end of it. Eventually I came to a luxurious looking room, decorations made of stralite and gold lining the walls and displayed pictures of what I assumed to be important figures in Shaloren history. Here I was told to wait, and left by the lieutenant as he entered a nearby room.]], [[[i]我仍然对永恒精灵反对纹身的程度感到十分震惊。似乎他们宁愿接受命运，也要避免使用它们。纹身的目的之一是在受伤后恢复健康，但对于永恒精灵来说，这更是避免死亡的最后手段。更重要的是，他们似乎不明白，推迟纹身的使用只会导致他们在长期内更多地使用纹身，如果不尽快修补他们的皮肤上的伤口，就会面临开放伤口的感染。[/i]

在接下来的几天里，我混合并制作了一些纹身，供永恒精灵使用。工作间里有所有睡觉的便利设施，治疗师经常给我带来基本的主食和饮料。好吧，我应该对永恒精灵说，这可能对它们来说是基本的食物和饮料，但按照自然精灵的标准，我受到了相当慷慨的对待。我的意思是，我知道矮人把酒当作主食来食用，但很明显，根据我拿到的葡萄酒的数量来看，永恒精灵也差不多。不管怎样，我受到的待遇比我预料的要好得多。

大约在第四天，在我做了大量的纹身后，我被他们要求协助使用它们。我治疗过的许多人都快死了，他们被仅仅包扎伤口带来的溃烂感染所困扰。和我在那个简易安置点里对待受伤的永恒精灵的方式类似，我只是尽可能用纹身把他们从鬼门关带回来而已。这并不是因为缺少纹身，而是因为永恒精灵似乎出于某种原因对纹身有着固执的心态。

大约一个星期后，在大多数难民受到治疗后，永恒精灵士兵的一个分遣队的消息传来，他们与兽人战斗后返回埃尔瓦拉。很明显，当魔法大爆炸发生时，他们一直在大陆的东部和东部的人类王国并肩作战。少数仍然活着的人准备返回埃尔瓦拉，但他们由于无法直接穿越大陆中部而停滞不前。在那些幸存下来的人中，只有几百人设法活着回来。

在这个时刻，在我治疗了数百人之后，我至少对我治疗过的那些人有了一些同情。但更吸引我注意的是他们所说的自己无法直接前往埃尔瓦拉这一点。在大陆中部的米德瓦尔平原是一个广阔的平原，可以看作一片真正的平地。根据我的地理学基础知识，这片平原是完全开放的，很容易穿越。除非有一支庞大的兽人军队幸存下来并封锁了他们的道路，否则根本没有必要在这个地区向北移动。

我没有想太久，一个助理治疗师就走过来，递给我一堆装在皮包里的奇怪平板。我把其中一个拿出来，注意到上面刻着一个发光的徽章，看起来像是某种奥术的力量。当我转过身去问这些是干什么用的时候，我发现对方已经走开了，因为治疗师已经开始照料进入大楼的士兵了。对于该如何处理这些奇怪的平板，我感到困惑不解。正在这时，一个士兵拍了拍我的肩膀，吸引了我的注意。他的手很快伸过来，从袋子里拿出一片奇怪的平板。

我转过身去看那个士兵也在干什么，注意到他穿的黑色盔甲上有一道巨大的伤口。有一瞬间，我有些手足无措，因为我的手都拿着符文，无法抓起任何纹身，但后来，我注意到一件奇怪的东西。令人惊讶的是，平板上的徽章似乎在闪烁和移动，然后与士兵的手融合。一种淡蓝色的光芒从士兵的眼睛中闪过，一股奇怪的能量似乎在他的身体里流动。接下来发生的事情真的让我措手不及，士兵开始喃喃自语，他深深的伤口开始自行愈合。

我对于士兵身上发生的一切完全不知所措，他在我面前自愈了。随着时间的流逝，淡蓝色的光芒从他的眼睛中消失，双眼恢复了正常的颜色，他的伤口不仅愈合了，而且完全没有受伤的迹象。这是我第一次看到使用符文和治疗法术。我以前听说过法术的使用，但在那时，我甚至从来没有听说过符文的，甚至不知道符文的存在。我很快就知道，我得到的平板被称为法力风暴符文，它们可以恢复一个人体内的法力值。

直到现在，我对奥术魔法都不太了解，也不知道它是如何工作的，但是很明显，从魔法大爆炸那时起，某些东西已经永久地改变了魔法的工作方式，虽然通过训练仍然可以召唤魔法的力量，但这比以前困难得多。其他受伤的士兵在以同样的方式来进行治疗，他们手拿着法力风暴符文，在他们的手上，胳膊上，腿上，或者任何他们想要的身体部位上嵌入发光的印记，然后开始施法，迅速治愈他们自己，或者治愈其他士兵。

过了一段时间，受伤的士兵开始减少，因为他们中的大多数人在痊愈后不需要休息。当痊愈士兵的数量开始达到一定程度时，主治医师代表永恒精灵来感谢我的努力。我突然想起我来这里的全部原因，意识到我已经完成了我的交易。当一名士兵走近时，主治医师向我点头，看着我，回答说：“中尉会护送你去见将军。”我对此感到有些吃惊，但我认为这位将军对所发生的事件有了答案。

士兵把我带到市中心，那里有一座宏伟的建筑物。在会见了几个身穿闪亮装甲从头武装到脚的警卫后，我们被允许进入。我们在大楼的大厅里走了几分钟，似乎走到了大楼的尽头。最后，我来到了一个豪华的房间，墙壁上有着斜长石和黄金做成的装饰，并展示了一些我认为是永恒精灵历史上重要人物的画像。在这里，中尉让我等着，然后走进附近的一个房间。]], "_t")

t([[[i]General Aranion Gaweil, leader of the Grand Council of Elvala. This was perhaps the first name I ever learned from someone outside my family. While Aranion never gave his name to me personally, the rest of the shaloren certainly banter it around enough to the point that I eventually remembered it. While perhaps there is little to acknowledge from one who readily gives their name, I can perhaps respect Aranion whose name I learned from those around him, and the idolization and fondness that they seemed to speak it with.[/i]

Before long the soldier reappeared and I was ushered into a much more plain room. A desk sat in the middle of the room and a row of windows that viewed the forest to the north behind it. On the side of the room sat what appeared to be an impressive display of armor, and a fierce looking weapon laying in the center. Making my way into the office, I saw who I assumed to be the general, viewing some papers near a table in the corner of the room. He seemed to exude an aura of brilliance that made the other shaloren look dull, though I could sense a weight of something seemingly hang around him.

With a solemn discerning stare he looked me up and down before directing me to a seat next to the desk in the middle of the room. Nodding in the direction of the lieutenant, the soldier who had escorted me quietly left the room, closing the door and leaving us alone. As directed, I proceeded to sit down while the man took a seat in another chair on the other side. Almost immediately as he sat down he began to speak "From what I have been told by the doctors and from reports given to me by the rangers, you have spent several days helping to tend to many wounded shaloren, and for this I thank you."

Before I could say anything, the shalore seemingly began to talk again "I have to say, I was in a bit of disbelief when I was informed of you. A couple of my advisors offered to meet with you, but I had to see for myself that there was actually a thalore here. To my knowledge, a rare few of you thalore have stepped foot outside of your forest in the last four millennia. You might be the only thalore I meet in my lifetime you see, and I wouldn't pass up the chance to meet one of you thalore in person." The shalore seemed to smile after saying this, though I was becoming rather annoyed. If there was a reason for me coming here, getting gawked at wasn't it.

Taking a breath before continuing to speak again the general continued "Before continuing with this discussion however, I feel the need to ask why? What would compel you to leave your forests and make the trip down to Shaloren lands?" His questions caused me to pause in a moment. Any bloodlust that I had felt upon the initial devastation of the Spellblaze had since left me. Really, I had no reason anymore for having come down here. After a moment I replied in a harsh tone "Do I need to give any reason?" The rather straightforward response seemingly got me a quick smirk.

Slyly he stated "Well, I imagined that if a thalore would have any reason to leave that forest of yours and come down here it would have been to exact a bloody massacre on any shalore they would come across." I guess I was read like an open book at that moment, seen right through from my exterior to my internal thoughts. I shrank back a bit at this point, seemingly confirming to the general my inner thoughts. To this he seemed to relax a bit before saying "Obviously something changed your mind since you haven't killed any shaloren that I am aware of and in fact have been a great help to my people. For that, I will tell you what I know."

Eventually, the shalore proceeded to tell me of the events that had transpired leading up to this point. I learned that the calamity released upon the land was named the Spellblaze, and that it had been unleashed in the hopes of defeating the orcs who up to that point had been sweeping across the land. While the Shaloren had the best of intentions, the mages in charge had lost control of the vast energies they had tried to command and torched both the orcs, themselves, and the whole of Maj'Eyal in a wave of destructive energy. Devastation of all kinds swept across the continent, some perhaps not even of our world.

Quietly I listened as I was told all of this until everything was relayed to me. As he finished telling me the story of the Spellblaze, I was of mixed feelings as how to judge the actions of the Shaloren. On one hand the Spellblaze had been released across the lands leaving scars on it that may never heal, but I understood that they had acted to stop what he believed to be an unprecedented threat. As a result of their actions too, I knew that all the shaloren were now suffering, and I had already decided that was punishment enough for them.

The discomfort within my mind was obviously made clear across the desk, but the general refrained from saying anything, perhaps out of some underlying guilt for his part in the Spellblaze or just due to being unable to say anything that could aid in my aligning my thoughts. For a time we sat in silence, though before long he soon got up and headed towards the window. His back turned I couldn't see his expression, but I could tell he thought heavily in regards to how events had unfolded. [i]Aranion if you are reading this now, know that at least I have forgiven you.[/i] ]], [[[i]艾伦尼恩·加威尔将军，埃尔瓦拉大议会领袖。这也许是我学到的第一个我家庭以外的人的名字。虽然艾伦尼恩从未亲自告诉我他的名字，但其他永恒精灵说了实在太多次，以至于我最终记住了。虽然对于习惯于说出自己名字的人群来说这没什么奇怪的，但我也许可以尊重我从他周围的人那里学到了他的名字的艾伦尼恩，以及其他人谈论他时表现出的憧憬和热爱。[/i]

不久，士兵又出现了，我被领进了一个更朴素的房间。房间中央有一张桌子，后面有一排窗户，可以看到北面的森林。房间的一边放着一件看起来令人印象深刻的盔甲，一件看起来凶猛的武器躺在中间。我走进办公室，看见了应该是将军的人，他正在浏览放在房间一侧桌子上的一些文字。他的周围似乎散发出一种明亮的光环，使周围的永恒精灵看起来黯然失色，尽管我能感觉到，他的心头似乎始终挂着某种沉重的东西。

他用一种严肃而敏锐的目光上下打量着我，然后把我引向房间中间桌子旁边的一个座位。护送我的士兵朝中尉的方向点头，悄悄地离开了房间，关上了门，让我们两个人呆着。按照指示，我继续坐下，而那个人坐在另一边的另一张椅子上。几乎就在他坐下的同时，他开始说道：“根据治疗师告诉我的情况，和游侠们给我的报告，你花了几天时间帮助照顾许多受伤的永恒精灵，为此我向你表示真诚的感谢。”

我还没来得及说什么，那位永恒精灵又接着说了下去，“我不得不说，当我得知你的消息时，我有点不相信这一点。我的几个顾问提出要见你，但得知来了一个自然精灵，我决定亲自来看看你。据我所知，在过去的四千年里，你们中很少有人踏出森林。你可能是我有生之年见到的唯一一个自然精灵，我不会放过和你其中一个自然精灵见面的机会。”说完这句话，永恒精灵轻轻笑了起来，但我感到十分恼火。如果我来这里是有原因的话，这原因显然不是被别人当做珍奇动物一样盯着看。

将军深吸一口气，继续说道：“然而，在继续讨论之前，我觉得有必要问，为什么？是什么迫使你离开了森林，来到永恒精灵的土地？”他的问题使我停顿了一会儿。魔法大爆炸造成的破坏在我心中留下的嗜血的复仇愿望，现在已经从我的身上消失了。真的，我已经再也没有理由来这里了。过了一会儿，我用严厉的语气回答说：“我需要说明什么理由吗？”这个相当直截了当的回答，让我很快笑了起来。

他狡黠地说：“好吧，我想如果一个自然精灵有任何理由离开你的森林来到这里，那就是血腥屠杀他们遇到的任何一个永恒精灵。”我想那时的我就像一本打开的书，从我的外表到我的内在思想都被看得一清二楚。我退缩了一点，似乎证实他看透了我内心的想法。对此，他似乎放松了一点，然后说：“很明显，有些事情改变了你的想法，因为你没有杀害任何永恒精灵，我知道，事实上你为我的人民提供了珍贵的帮助。为此，我会告诉你我所知道的一切。”

最终，永恒精灵继续告诉我发生了什么事情，导致了现在的局面。我了解到，在陆地上发生的灾难的名字叫做魔法大爆炸，最初的目的是为了打败那些劫掠整片大陆的兽人。虽然永恒精灵们有着美好的意图，但掌管这一切的法师们失去了对他们试图控制的巨大能量的控制，并在一股毁灭性的能量浪潮中烧毁了兽人、他们自己和整个马基埃亚尔。各种各样毁灭性的灾害席卷了整个大陆，甚至包括我们的世界之外的地方。

我静静地听着对方告诉我的一切，直到他把一切的故事都转达给我。当他给我讲完魔法大爆炸的故事时，我对如何判断永恒精灵的行为感到心情复杂。一方面，魔法大爆炸的破坏在世界各地蔓延开来，留下了永远无法愈合的伤疤，但我明白，他们的行动阻止了他认为是前所未有的威胁。由于他们的行为，我知道所有的永恒精灵现在都在承受着极其巨大的困难，我想，这样的惩罚对于它们已经足够了。

我心里的不安很明显在桌子的另一边清楚地表现出来，但是将军什么也没说。也许，这是因为他在魔法大爆炸中所扮演的角色带来的潜在的内疚感，或者，这仅仅是因为他不能说任何有助于我理顺思路的话。我们沉默地坐了一会儿，不久他就站起来朝窗户走去。他转过身来，我看不出他的表情，但我可以看出他正在对事态的发展深思熟虑。[i]艾伦尼恩，如果你现在正在读这本书的话，请知道，起码现在我已经原谅了你。[/i] ]], "_t")

t([[[i]At the time I had thought Aranion to be quite paranoid, but his ability to perceive the thoughts of others and the activities taking place in the world can be described as unnaturally accurate. While the group that instigates the Spellhunt remains unknown while I write this, they were out there and I would witness their activities firsthand.[/i]

After a time the shalore finally asked "What are planning to do now?" Good question I thought. "I haven't really thought of that yet,” I replied. Though his back was still turned, I could feel the smirk through the back of his head. Turning towards me he seemingly asked "I suppose that you will likely be heading back to your forest, but perhaps on the way you could do something to help us shaloren out. Would you be interested in running some aid supplies for us?" Looks like I'm going to be made use of again I thought, though I then wondered a little bit about the request.

Curiously I stated "I would think that after all that you have told me you would try to garner any remaining good will you could for the Shaloren. Wouldn't any aid be better sent by an official Shaloren emissary?" Solemnly the general responded "It isn't so much that I wouldn't mind doing that, but it is too dangerous for any shalore to be outside of Elvala right now. Before you arrived here in Elvala several humans from the lands to the west descended on our borders in anger. Many of the shaloren you had rescued from the outlying settlements fell prey not to the devastation of the Spellblaze, but rather to the wrath of the peasants and farmers from the Cornac lands."

I could feel a grave shift in his tone as he continued, "Then they approached us here in Elvala to do the same. Perhaps you saw some of their corpses as you entered through the Shroud when you came in." For a moment he said nothing as the impact of everything stated seeped into my mind. He continued again in a normal tone, "Of course, it isn't just a terse moment of anger that keeps me from sending an envoy out, someone is stirring the people of the other lands to action. I don't know who or what organization is doing so, but I fear greatly for what some of the humans yelled when they came."

The generals eyes soon crossed with mine, the serious manner of them captivating me. Feeling compelled to ask I said, "What did they yell?" In the same grave tone as before he stated, "They yelled that the Shaloren will pay for the Spellblaze." A bit cluelessly I said "Why would you fear mere words stating their rightful anger at you?" To this I received the firm answer "Because none but a few would have known that we called our grand plan the Spellblaze. To the various leaders of the races and even to your king and queen we only mentioned that we would be using the Sher'Tul ruins for a grand feat of magic. Someone told those human commoners that we were responsible, but they slipped up, I can tell some sort of clandestine operation is underway against my people."

For a moment I stayed silent, before finally rising from my seat. Making a decision I stated firmly, "Then I will run your aid supplies for you. What would you have me do?" Relaxing to this the general promptly answered back to me, "As I'm sure you are aware, a shaloren doesn't really make much use of infusions, or any other natural remedy for that matter. We do have quite a bit of ingredients stored up though, and they could be better used to help out elsewhere. I'll procure a special chest that can be used to store all of the ingredients that can be spared and have you deliver it to the nearby Nargol Kingdom. Right now many refugees from the other races are pouring into their capital, and they likely don't have ingredients to make all the infusions they will need."

Nodding to this I motioned that I was ready to leave, but the general held up his hand and motioned for me to stop. He proceeded to make his way over to the table where he was first positioned in the room when I came in. Looking at me before turning to pick up some things, the shalore approached and pressed a rune firmly into the palm of my hand, causing a pinkish glow to emit before stating "You can use this Rune of Return to reenter Elvala from wherever you may be. Know that you will welcome to do so at anytime." Giving a nod, the general also handed me a requisition order, allowing me to pick up some traveling gear from his rangers for my travels.

When I was ready the next day after having met with the rangers quartermaster, I headed towards the city gates where I was met one last time by the general, accompanied by a small cadre of mages, as well as an assortment of well armed and armored bodyguards. As I approached them the general stated that the mages would teleport me to a location close to the halfling city. He then handed me a small and near weightless chest and some papers with an official Shaloren insignia on them. While I realized that the papers were likely a diplomatic message, I ignorantly wondered what the purpose of the chest was, or where the infusion ingredients I had been tasked to deliver were at.

When asked of this, one of the mages approached to take the chest from me, and demonstrating its use and purpose, pulled out several ingredients for infusions stored within - seemingly more than could possibly fit within the chest itself. Taking back the chest when it was refilled, I was then told by the general that when I reached the gates to the Nargol Kingdom that all I should have to do is present the papers, and the Nargol Guards would take the chest. I would likely be allowed inside their capital, and could buy any additional needed supplies I might need from there. After saying this, the general then handed me a pouch of coin for that very purpose.

Thanking the general, I was then escorted to a small circle in which a runic design had been marked. The mages began to chant and weave their hands. My vision blurred as the surroundings around me began to dance. Then I saw dead trees and a nearby river colored black come into focus as the images of Elvala faded away. As my vision recovered I could hear the sounds of the new location I now found myself in. I stepped out into a clearing looking down a blasted hillside. As I looked around to get my bearings I could see movement of a great many dwarves, humans, and halflings streaming towards the ruined gates of a great city, of which I assumed to be the capital of the Nargol Kingdom.

Putting the chest in my pack, I began to make my way towards the road leading to the gates as well. I did not know this but what I thought would be a brief stop on my way back to my home forests would soon herald the start of another adventure for me. I would find atrocities within the home of the Nargols that would only be dwarfed by the devastation caused by the Spellblaze. Such were the earlier events of what would soon be called the Spellhunt, which even now spreads over the face of Maj'Eyal, and threatens to throw all the races ever closer to oblivion.]], [[[i]当时我认为艾伦尼恩相当偏执，但要谈到他预测他人思想和世界上发生的活动的能力，可以说他的预测有着一种不自然的精确。虽然在我写这篇文章的时候，煽动魔法狩猎的组织还不为人所知，但他们已经出现了，我亲眼目睹了他们的活动。[/i]

过了一会儿，永恒精灵终于问：“现在，你打算怎么办？”我想，这是一个好问题。“我还没有真正想过，”我回答。他转过身来，我能感受到他的脸上未加掩藏的笑容。他转向我，似乎在问：“我想你很可能会回到你的森林，但也许在路上你可以做些什么来帮助我们永恒精灵。你有兴趣为我们提供一些援助吗？”看来我又要被利用了，我想，虽然我当时有点想知道他的请求是什么。

出于好奇，我问道：“我想，在你告诉我所有这些之后，你会尽力为永恒精灵争取到任何剩余的善意。我想，派出一位一位永恒精灵的官方使者为我们提供援助是不是更好呢？”将军郑重地回答说：“我不介意这么做，但现在对于任何永恒精灵来说，离开埃尔瓦拉都太危险了。在你到达埃尔瓦拉之前，一群来自西部的人类愤怒地进攻了我们的边境。那些你从边远居民点救出的永恒精灵，它们中间许多人所遭受的毁灭，并不是来自于魔法大爆炸带来的灾难，而是死在愤怒的科纳克人农民的刀下。”

我能感觉到他语气的强烈转变，他继续说，“然后他们前进到埃尔瓦拉，想要对我们做同样的事情。也许你穿过埃尔瓦拉帷幕进来时，已经看到了他们的一些尸体，”有一瞬间，他什么也没说，让这句陈述的影响慢慢渗透到了我的脑海中。紧接着，他又用正常的语气继续说：“当然，这不仅仅是因为这样短暂的愤怒我无法派出特使，还有人在煽动其他国家的人民采取行动。我不知道是谁，也不知道是什么组织在这么做，但是我听到了那些人类高喊着的口号，所以深感忧虑。”

将军的视线和我交汇，他严肃的态度吸引了我。我迫不及待地问：“他们喊了什么？”他用和之前一样严肃的语气说：“他们高喊，‘永恒精灵要为魔法大爆炸付出代价！’”我有点笨拙地问：“你为什么要害怕那些表明他们对你正当愤怒的话呢？”对此，我得到了坚定的回答，“因为只有少数人知道，我们把我们的宏伟计划称为‘魔法大爆炸’。对于其他种族的领袖，甚至是你的国王和王后，我们只提到，我们将利用夏·图尔废墟来完成一项伟大的魔法壮举。有人告诉那些人类平民，我们对此负有责任，但他们失手了。我可以说，有人正在针对我的人民正在进行某种秘密行动。”

我沉默了一会儿，最后才从座位上站起来。我做出了最后的决定，坚定地说：“那我就替你运输你的援助物资。你要我怎么办？”将军放松下来，马上回答我说：“我确信你会这么做的。永恒精灵并没有充分利用纹身或其他任何自然疗法。不过，我们确实储存了不少原料，它们可以更好地用于帮助其他地方。我会采购一个特殊的箱子，可以用来储存所有可以使用的原料，让你把它送到附近的纳格尔王国。现在，许多来自其他种族的难民涌入他们的首都，他们可能没有足够的原料来制造他们需要的所有纹身。”

我点头示意，准备离开，但将军举起手示意我停下。他继续走到我进来时他第一次被安排在房间里的桌子旁。在转身去拿东西之前，永恒精灵看着我，走近我，把一个符文紧紧地压在我的手掌上，发出粉红色的光芒，然后说：“你可以用这个返回符文，从任何你可能在的地方重新进入埃尔瓦拉。我们随时都会欢迎你回来。”我点了点头，将军也给了我一张申请单，让我从他的游侠那里拿些旅行装备来旅行。

第二天，当我准备好与游侠军需官会面后，我朝着城门走去，在那里，我最后一次见到了将军，随行的还有一小队法师，以及各种全副武装，身穿重甲的保镖。当我接近他们时，将军说法师们会把我传送到一个靠近半身人城市的地方。然后，他递给我一个小到几乎没有重量的箱子，和一些上面有永恒精灵官方徽章的文件。尽管我意识到这些文件可能是一个外交信息，但我无知地想知道这个箱子的用途是什么，或者我被指派运送的纹身材料在哪里。

当我问起这个问题时，其中一个法师走近我，从我身上取下这个箱子，并展示了它的用途。他拿出了一些储存在里面的纹身材料——看起来远远超过了箱子本身的容量。当他把装满的箱子还给我的时候，将军告诉我，当我到达纳格尔王国的大门时，我所要做的就是出示文件，纳格尔的卫兵会拿走箱子。我会被允许进入他们的首都，并可以从那里购买任何我可能需要的额外用品。说完，将军就递给我一袋金币。

我感谢将军，然后被护送到了里面有一个符文图案一个小圆圈中。法师们开始吟诵，连接起他们的手。我周围的环境开始起舞，视野中也变得一片模糊。在模糊中，我看到死去的树木和附近一条黑色的河流，随着埃尔瓦拉的形象逐渐从我的视野中消失。当我的视力恢复时，我听到了完全不同的声音，意识到自己到了一个全新的地方。我走出去，走进一片空地，下面是一片被炸毁的山坡。当我环顾四周寻找方向时，我可以看到许多矮人、人类和半身人朝着一座大城市的破败城门流去，看来这座城市就是纳格尔王国的首都。

我把箱子放进背包里，开始朝通往大门的路走去。我原以为这只是我回到家乡森林的路途中的短暂停留，却不知道这预示着我又一次冒险的开始。我在纳格尔王国的领地里发现了一场暴行的开始，一场破坏力只有魔法大爆炸可以比你的暴行。这就是被称为魔法狩猎的事件的早期过程，这一事件最终蔓延到了整个马基·埃亚尔，并将所有的种族带到了更加接近毁灭的边缘。]], "_t")

t([[[i]While on the surface the Nargols appeared to be in total control of the situation, underneath it all this was very much not the case. In order to attempt to mitigate trouble they actively attempted to confiscate any and all magical items they could find from the refugees entering the city, and hide their leaders from being assassinated for their parts in the Spellblaze. Spellcasters in their army were sent underground, mindful of the danger they were in, but also not wishing to incite angry citizens further.[/i]

I descended slowly and carefully down the blasted hillside, and crossed over the river where some stones emerged that I could step on. Making my way over burned grass I joined with the procession of refugees making their way towards the city gates. I had to wait a long while as the guards slowly inspected wagons and asked questions of those passing through. While it seemed no one was being turned away, drawing closer I saw one dwarf begin to holler as a guard confiscated an item from him. The dwarf was still hollering when he was allowed entry, a torrent of profanity coming from the dwarf for every step he took inside.

After a dozen more or so in front of me were processed by the guards, I was finally next. I immediately held out the papers I have received from the general. The guard nearest to me gave notice to the insignia on them, and motioned to another of the guards to come over. After glancing at the papers together, they talked to each other in a hushed tone, and then one of them proceeded to run off with the paper at a brisk pace to a nearby tower. Before long the guard returned, followed by another halfling. Judging from the immaculate armor he wore, I quickly realized he must be their superior.

He walked towards me with a slow methodical pace, his gaze seemingly analyzing me fully. Standing in front of me, his eyes looked up into mine as I looked down on him. Then he abruptly turned away, and gestured to one of the guards. The guard immediately approached and held out has hands. Sensing that I should give the chest now, I pulled it out of my pack and handed it to him. Giving a quick nod as he received the chest, the guard quickly hurried away with it. He dashed through the gate and rounded around the walls out of sight. Another guard soon approached and in a polite tone stated, "Welcome to the Nargol Kingdom."

With this I was ushered through the gate as the guards began to resume their searches and queries to the refugees behind me. Looking around, I saw a great many tents and hastily constructed shanties, likely put up to house the many refugees flooding into the city. The refugees themselves sat around as if devoid of any purpose. Some lifelessly stared towards the west, likely to settlements they had been forced to come from. Others seem to stare blankly towards the sky as if perhaps waiting for more death to fall from it as it had during the Spellblaze.

Saddened by the site of all this and the sense of loss that hanged in the air I decided to move on. I navigated myself towards the buildings of the settlement. Ruins of destroyed buildings lay across the street with some featuring collapsed roofs and walls. I could see through the gaps in the stones of one of the damaged buildings a family of halflings. Further down the street a wooden sign for a tavern lay on the ground. Feeling somewhat peckish at this point I made my way towards the building next to the sign hoping that they may have some food to purchase.

Inside a motley collection of halflings, humans, and dwarves sat at various tables. A bit more lively than the refugees outside, some conversed with each other while others gambled. As I entered the tavern, one human immediately took notice and approached saying "hey, aren't you that thalore before? Yea, it is you." Wondering who this human was I wondered if he was perhaps insane. Seemingly sensing this he quickly stated, "Ahh, perhaps you don't recognize me. I'm the messenger that happen to be in that inn up north. You probably remember me arguing with that Eldoral halfwit from before."

I clenched my teeth a bit. I wondered if I might be in trouble. Again however the human made another quick statement, "Don't worry, I don't think you'll find anyone disagreeing with what you did to him and I was thinking of doing the same anyway. He would have eventually been lynched for saying things as he did. Someone would have silenced him sooner or later." Curious as to what the messenger just said I cautiously replied, "What do you mean?" To this the messenger raised an eyebrow before stating, "What? You think that any of the guards here would stop someone like that halfling from being killed? Such incidents have become common place nowadays."

Soon smiling at me, the messenger began to gesture towards a nearby seat. I wasn't much interested in chatting with him, but thinking perhaps he may be able to inform me a bit of events I decided to accept his offer. I moved to sit down, ordering some food to eat. The messenger began making small talk, noting the devastation wrought from the Spellblaze, viciously attacking 'the mages' within each of his sentences, and lamenting the loss of some of his friends. For a time I let him talk as I ate my food. Oddly enough, the messenger didn't give me his name or ask for my own; perhaps being at least somewhat knowledgeable of Thaloren customs in that regard. I didn't actually notice this when I talked to him initially, only realizing it due to later events that would unfold.]], [[[i]表面上，纳格尔人的整体状况还在掌控之中，然而实际上，完全不是这样的。为了努力减少麻烦，他们尽全力去没收所有进城难民的魔法物品。同时，为了防止他们的领袖因为他们在魔法大爆炸中扮演的角色成为暗杀的目标，他们把他藏了起来。军队中的法师们也不得不地下活动，以防止受到危险，更希望不要进一步激怒那些已经愤怒的市民。[/i]

我慢慢潜行，小心翼翼走过被炸毁的山坡，踩着因地震而冒出的岩石度过河流。我穿过烧焦的草地，加入了向城门走去的难民队伍。我不得不等着，因为守卫不仅仔细检查马车，还要对进城的人进行盘问。但是看起来似乎没人被禁止进城。临近，我看到一个矮人正在抱怨，因为一个守卫没收了他的一件物品。即使士兵允许他进城的之后，他仍然不停抱怨，一路走一路发出一连串矮人的脏话。

在等待若干人通过士兵检查之后，终于轮到我了。我立即上交了将军给我的手信，离我最近的士兵注意到信上的徽章之后，示意其他士兵都过来。他们一起看完了信件，小声地互相嘀咕，然后，其中一个士兵带着信件即刻启程，步履轻盈的奔向最近的塔楼。不久，那个士兵回来了，同行的还有另一个半身人。从他那完美无瑕的盔甲来看，我很快意识到这个人一定是他们的上级。

他缓缓而有条不紊地走向我，他的目光似乎把我看穿了。他站在我面前，我低头看着他，他的眼睛向上看着我。然后，他突然转过身，示意其中一个士兵过来。那名士兵立即上前并伸出了双手，意味着我现在应该交出那个箱子了。我打开背包，把箱子交给了他。在拿到箱子之后他立即点头示意，然后迅速带着箱子离开。只看见他冲进大门，绕过墙之后，就消失在视野之外了。另一名士兵走向我，然后用礼貌的口吻说道，“欢迎来到纳格尔王国”。

说着，我被领进了大门，卫兵们开始对我身后的难民进行搜查和询问。环顾四周，我看到很多帐篷和仓促搭建的棚屋，可能是用来安置涌入城市的难民的。难民们自己则无所事事地坐着，好像没有任何目标一样。一些人死气沉沉地盯着西方，那里是他们强迫离开的家乡所在的方向。其他人似乎是呆呆的看着天空，似乎在害怕有更多的死亡从空中降临，就像在魔法大爆炸时一样。

我为这一切感到悲哀，也为弥漫在空气中的失落感感到悲伤，我决定继续前进。我朝着居民的房屋走去，毁坏的建筑物的废墟横躺在街道上，一些房子的屋顶和墙壁都倒塌了。我能从一幢损坏的房屋的石缝中看到一户半身人人家。再往前走，地上有一个酒馆的木制路标。这时我感到有点饿了，就朝路标旁边的房子走去，希望能够买些食物。

酒馆里充斥着各类种族，半身人，人类和矮人坐在桌旁。相比于外面的难民们，这里似乎更活跃一些。一些难民们在聊天，一些在赌博。当我进入酒馆的时候，一个人类立刻注意到了我，走了过来说，“嗨，你不就是以前的哪个自然精灵吗？是的，就是你。”我不知道这个人类是谁，我也不知道他是不是疯了。他似乎感受到了这种异样的气氛，立刻说到，“哈，你可能没有认出我。我是北边酒馆的信使，兴许你还记得我和艾德瑞尔的死矮子争论过” 

我微微咬紧牙关，在想我是不是会遇到麻烦。然而，那个人类又做了一个简短的补充，“别担心，我觉得你不会找到任何一个反对你做过的事情的人，如果我是你，我也会这么做的。他最终一定会因为他说过的话而被人干掉。迟早会有人让他闭嘴的。”对于信使的话我很好奇，我谨慎的回应他说：“你是什么意思？” 信使挑了一下眉，说：“什么？你觉得这里的那些士兵能够阻止像那个半身人那样的人被杀吗？这样的事情现在已经很常见了。”

随后，信使微笑的看着我，对着附近的座位打手势。我不是很想和他聊天，但是考虑到他或许能够告诉我一些情报，我决定接受他的邀请。我走过来坐下，点了一些吃的充饥。信使开始闲聊起来，特别提到了魔法大爆炸造成的破坏，他的每一句话都恶毒的攻击“法师们”，然后又表现出失去朋友的悲伤。我一边吃饭，一边让他一直说，持续了整整一段时间。奇怪的是，这位信使并没有告诉我他的名字，也没有问我的，或许他至少在这方面对自然精灵的风俗有一定的了解。一开始我并么有意识到这一点，之后再后来的事情中我才知道。]], "_t")

t([[[i]You know, it is really hard to know someone. The messenger was a good example of this, as I would soon find out. I had pegged him for being a disgruntled human that had suffered greatly because of the Spellblaze. In reality he was much more than just disgruntled, and I believe he may have been a member of the group instigating the Spellhunt. I'm sure he and the others who had left after with that human in the dark cloak died taking part in a nefarious plot that I would learn the day after. But did he die willingly? That's the real question I think about now in regards to him.[/i]

Finishing my meal, I decided to probe the messenger for information. Upon the completion of his last tirade I asked, "So how are things faring here?" A sigh escaped the man as he answered, "Well, the Nargols appear to have everything under control. They are managing to get enough food for all the refugees streaming in; even managed to procure some alcohol for those dwarves. I have to say it was quite a surprise to see them out here. I wonder if they happen to have anymore homes elsewhere on the continent outside of the Iron Throne. Hard to really know with how secretive the dwarves are though."

While I wasn't exactly interested in the dwarves, that last statement disconnected quite a bit from what I knew about them. From my knowledge of the dwarves, they all lived in the Iron Throne, or at least cities nearby to it. Querying the messenger he soon explained. "Well, the dwarves you see here now had a home over there in the western mountains. The Cornacs were completely ignorant that they had taken up residence so close to them, and the dwarves likely would have kept it a secret. Unfortunately for them they were forced to show themselves since the blasted mages caused their home to collapse in on them."

Satisfied with that answer I remembered about that hollering dwarf when entering the city. I wondered if perhaps the messenger might know something about what that was all about. Noting it I said, "You wouldn't happen to know anything regarding items the dwarves might be carrying that the guards at the city gates would confiscate would you?" The messengers soldiers shrugged before he replied back, "Likely was carrying some item of arcane properties that an accursed mage enchanted long ago. Those dwarves seem to be getting the worse treatment in regards to that, what with the little care they give towards whether an item is contaminated with magic or not."

Shaking his head before going on, the messenger mused aloud, "You know, the Nargol are actively attempting to confiscate items of magical origin as a means of appeasement to placate the halflings living here. They say that it's too dangerous for civilians to carry such items. Personally I say it is too dangerous for anyone to be carrying such items, them included. Of course they are too arrogant to bother fellow halflings living in the city already in regards to giving up such items, expecting them to 'voluntarily' give them up. Really it is just the dwarves, the halfling refugees from outside the city, and us humans getting our possessions taken away." The human proceeded to laugh as he finished saying these words.

The messenger stopped laughing though as a human in a dark cloak approached and leaned down to say something to him. The messenger nodded to the figure upon which he said back, "I'll catch up later, relay back to me the plan when we are ready." To this the human in the dark cloak bowed, hurried over to another table with a couple of halflings and then a table with a dwarf, before then leaving the establishment and disappearing. The halflings and the dwarf finished their food and packed up their things before they quietly left as well. Wondering just who this messenger was I glanced at him to see he examining eyes looking towards me. In a relaxed voice the messenger said, "Don't mind them, were having such a nice conversation to have the others ruin it."

At that point I realized that there was more to this human than I had initially thought. I wondered if he might be a bit more dangerous than I was giving him credit for. Perhaps a bit rashly I decided to see just how much this man knew, and so I quietly stated, "You wouldn't happen to have any plans to deal with the Shaloren?" Almost instantly the mans stance and posture changed before in a new tone he continued to speak, "Oh wouldn't it be so great to wipe those miserable louts from the face of Eyal. I assume you likely left your forest because you know they were responsible and would like nothing more than to bathe in their blood. Don't most of us all. In due time they will be made to pay in full for for unleashing the Spellblaze on Maj'Eyal."

Cautiously I asked in as angry of a voice as I could muster, "Spellblaze, is that what they call it?" Quickly confirming back to me this he stated "indeed, or so I have been told." Seeing as how the man liked to talk I waited for him to feed me more information "I tell you what, perhaps you should come with me to a little gathering of friends to discuss it. We've got a plan that we will be putting into motion soon to ensure nature never suffers as badly as I'm sure you a thalore can feel it suffer. You see, while the Shaloren are most definitely responsible it isn't like none of the other races knew about their so called grand plan. Every race, save for perhaps the Dwarves, had some knowledge of the Spellblaze."

Obviously the messenger was likely part of whatever group the shalore general had feared. I could tell that the messenger most definitely was in whatever schemes were being orchestrated too, and possibly ones that required secrecy as confirmed from the cloaked man from before. I considered going to his little gathering of friends, but I wasn't really interested in participating in whatever scheme they were going to partake in, and I could sense a feeling of danger as well. "I thank you for the offer, but I must decline" I finally said. To this I got a raised eyebrow as he quickly stated back, "Really, I would think a thalore such as yourself would jump at a chance to exact retribution against any who defile nature as has been done?"

His words made me think for a moment, but I simply got up and left. I remember him calling out that should I change my mind, that I would be 'welcomed as a new initiate for sure'. The sun had begun to set in the sky as I left the building. Figuring I should look for a place to stay for the night I found an inn and purchased a room. I figured that in the morning I would go to the market and buy some food and supplies for my journey home. I slept soundly until early in the morning before the sun had begun to rise when the sounds of screaming filled my ears. Wondering what was going on I looked out the window of my room to see fire and smoke rising from a large building in the distance.]], [[[i]你知道吗，了解一个人真的很难。我很快就发现那个信使就是一个很好的例子。我原来以为他是一个因为遭受了魔法大爆炸而心怀不满的人。实际上，他不仅仅是内心不满，我极大程度上相信他还是那个煽动魔法狩猎的组织的成员。我很确信，他，以及其他追随那个穿着深色斗篷的人类的家伙，因为卷入一场我事后知道的邪恶的阴谋而死。但他是自愿死去的吗？这是我现在真正想知道的关于他的问题。 [/i]

吃完了饭，我决定向这个信使打探消息。在他结束最后的激情演说之后，我问道：“那么事情进展如何了？” 他叹了口气，说：“现在纳格尔人似乎控制了一切。他们正在设法为所有涌进城内的难民们搞到足够的食物，甚至为矮人们设法搞到一些酒水。不得不说，看到他们这样做，我有点惊讶。我不知道除了钢铁王座之外，他们在大陆的其他地方是否还有家园。然而，要想真正了解矮人们的隐秘程度是很难的。”

虽然我对矮人们并不是很感兴趣，但最后这句话与我对他们的了解有很大的出入。据我对于矮人的了解，他们全部都生活在钢铁王座，或者至少居住在距离那里很近的城市。我对信使的话表示疑问，他随后解释到：“你现在在这看到的矮人们都住在西边的山里。科纳克人完全不知道矮人们住的距离他们那么近，而且矮人似乎对此保密。不幸的是，他们被迫暴露了自己，因为法师制造的爆炸摧毁了他们的家园。”

对于信使的回答我很满意，我突然会想起今早进城的时候遇到的那个骂骂咧咧的矮人。我在想，那个信使是不是知道一些什么东西。想到这一点，我问道：“你可能还不知道，士兵会没收矮人们携带的物品，知道吗？”信使耸了耸肩，回答道：“他们很可能携带某种，被那些该诅咒的法师很久以前附魔的，带有奥术力量的物品。在这方面，那些矮人们似乎受到了更糟糕的待遇，因为他们一点也不在乎这个物品是否被附魔过。”

他摇了摇头，若有所思的说道：“纳格尔人正积极的试图通过没收魔法物品，作为用来安抚居住在这里的半身人的一种手段。我个人认为任何人携带这样的物品都是非常危险的，包括他们自己。当然了，他们太过于傲慢，以至于他们不会去试图没收住在城里的半身人的魔法物品，指望着他们‘自愿’放弃。实际上，只有矮人、城市外面的半身人难民和我们人类的财产被夺走了。”那个人类说完这些话，就笑了起来。

当一个披着深色斗篷的人走近并弯下身对他说话时，信使停止了大笑。信使对着他回答的人点了点头，并说道：“我随后就到，等我们准备好了之后，再把计划跟我复述一遍。”那个身穿深色斗篷的人鞠了一躬，匆匆地走到了另一张有一对半身人夫妇的桌子，然后又走到一个矮人的桌子旁，再然后就离开这里消失了。那一对半身人夫妇和矮人吃完东西，收拾好行李，也悄悄的离开了。我想知道这个信使到底是谁，我瞥了他一眼，看到他正在用审视的目光看着我。信使用轻松的语气说道：“别理他们，我们谈的这么愉快，别被这些小事打扰了。”

在那一刻，我意识到这个信使比我最初想象的要复杂的多了。我想知道他是不是比我想象的还要危险一点。或许有一点鲁莽，我决定去了解这个男人到底知道多少，然后我轻声问道：“你对永恒精灵有什么想法？”那个信使的立场和姿态立马就变了，随后换了一种口吻继续说：“啊，要是能让把这群可悲的笨蛋彻底从埃亚尔扫除就好了。我想，你离开森林，恐怕就是因为知道他们才是罪魁祸首，准备让他们血债血偿。我们大多数人和你一样，他们终将会为在马基埃亚尔引发魔法大爆炸的行为付出代价。”

我谨慎的尽可能地用愤怒的语气问道：“你们把那个叫做魔法大爆炸？“他快速的肯定了这一说法：“是的，别人都是这样告诉我的。”这个男人看起来很愿意聊天，我等着他吐露更多的消息。“我告诉你，或许你应该和我一起去参加那个小型的朋友聚会，一起讨论这个问题。我们已经有了一个计划，我们会尽快行动，确保大自然不会再遭受和魔法大爆炸一样糟糕的事情，我相信你这个自然精灵一定能够感受到大自然的痛苦不堪。你知道么，永恒精灵他们绝对要对那个事件负责，但是并非其他种族都不知道他们那个所谓的伟大的计划。或许除了矮人，每一个种族都对魔法大爆炸有一定了解。”

很显然，这个信使很可能就是永恒精灵的将军所担心的那个组织的一员。我觉得那个信使一定参与了他们所说的那个计划，不管那个计划是什么。并且，从他与之前来过的穿斗篷的人的对话的反应来看，他们进行的计划还需要保密。我本来考虑去参加他的朋友聚会，但是我又对参与他们精心设计的计划不感兴趣，而且我能嗅到一丝危险的气息。“感谢你的邀请，但是我必须拒绝。”我最终说道。听到这个回答，信使挑了下眉，然后快速回答我：“说真的，像你这样的自然精灵，难道不想抓住任何机会，对玷污自然的人进行报复吗？”

他的话让我想了一会儿，但是我最终站起来，然后离开了。我记得他大声说道，如果我能改变主意，我会被“作为一个新兵而受到欢迎”。当我离开酒馆时，太阳已经开始落山了。考虑到我应该找一个地方过夜，我找到一个旅店然后开了一个房间。我打算早上的时候去市场买一些食物和补给为回家做准备。我睡得很沉，直到在清晨，太阳还没有升起的时候，我的耳朵里充满了尖叫声。我想知道发生了什么事情，打开了房间的窗户，发现远处的大楼燃起了大火，冒着浓烟。]], "_t")

t([[[i]In the market I purchased several items to help me for when I forged my way back towards Thaloren lands. I bought about three weeks worth of rations for myself as I had planned to perhaps 'explore' a little bit before finally arriving home. I also procured a fine steel utility knife and a steel hatchet. I wasn't sure I would really need this much for my journey, I could likely have explored the entirety of Maj'Eyal with it, but I never imagined what role everything I bought in that market would soon come to play in the future.[/i]

Out of my window I saw many residents of the city run to help deal with the fire. They quickly got to work in cordoning off the area and preventing it from further spreading, but despite their efforts, many homes were enveloped in flames before the fire was fully contained. Before long many soldiers arrived and pushed back everyone, including those residents helping to put out the fire. For a small while the fire was left to burn, though it soon began to diminish. I don't know how they did it, but soon after the fires began to die down. Maybe perhaps some mages had come out of hiding and they used water magic in secret to drown it out? It is hard to think of any other explanation.

As the fires began to simmer, some of the soldiers moved to inspect the burnt out homes for anyone who many not have escaped from the fire’s destruction. After that they moved on to investigate the building where the fire first started. I noticed after some of the soldiers had entered the building that they were pulling out several bundles wrapped in blankets. I would come to learn that these bundles were the remains of those suspected of starting the fire. Whether by accident or on purpose, they had been killed by their own act of arson. I would also learn that those killed consisted of a human, two halflings, and a dwarf. I'm certainly glad I left the messenger when I did.

During this time I remained in my room. When I finally left I talked with the innkeeper about the event, learning that the building was the one that housed many of the possessions that had been confiscated from the refugees. When I left the inn I could hear the conversations from many of the residents on the streets as they talked about the destruction of nearly every arcane item stored within the storehouse. They also murmured that some of the residents from the nearby homes were suspected to have been killed by the fire, as well a couple of the residents who had come to help put out the fire initially.

The fire would be talked about continually as I made my way to the Nargol market. Even there many of the merchants and patrons continued their talk of the event. Finishing up my purchases, it was at this point that I remembered another patron noting something about how the refugees were quite upset. I turned to approach the patron saying, "Exactly why would the refugees be upset." The patron, a halfling who wore fairly fine clothes but appeared to be of common work turned with a stunned look in my direction. Sighing I soon stated "Yes, I'm a thalore, what's up with the refugees." "Indeed you are,” the halfling quickly stated "well, I don't know why they are upset. You'd think they would be content with getting food and drink as well as being allowed to put up those miserable tents in the city. Something about the fire has seemingly stirred them up."

The halfling stopped talking to look up at something with a concerned expression, before turning around and abruptly running. As the halfling fled I soon heard the yelling behind me. Turning around I saw as a mob of ragged refugees rush through the stalls as the merchants began to flee. Wood was smashed and cloth torn as the refugees moved by them. I moved in the opposite direction away from them, but patrons and merchants who couldn't get away were knocked down and trampled. A few who attempted to stand up to the mob or protect their stalls soon found themselves beaten and bruised on the ground.

This continued for several minutes before the first guards appeared to have restored order. It took the guards several minutes to assemble themselves, within which the refugees continued to wreck a good deal of the market. When the guards finally moved in to clear them out, many of the refugees scattered, leaving debris and injured merchants and patrons everywhere. As order was restored to the scene, some guards came to check to see if I was alright before one of the guards pulled me aside to interrogate me as to what had happened. I relayed back to the guard the events as I had seen them unfolded. After telling my account I was directed to leave the area.

Moving away from the market I wondered what other scenes of chaos I might see if I remained within the Nargol city. While I had evaded danger, it could have very well been me getting trampled or knocked aside in that market. I made a decision then to begin making my way back towards the city gates. As I made my way towards the gates though I noticed a gathering mob of refugees and even some citizens in front of me. I should have headed past them but beyond them I heard a voice ringing out above. "The time has come for action, but it must be directed at the source of those behind all the harm." I stopped and turned my head as I heard the words, something compelling me to stay and listen to what was being said. Drawn in by the voice I began to make my way towards the outskirt of the crowd.]], [[[i]在市场上，我买了几件东西，以帮助我回到自然精灵的土地。我给自己买了大约三个星期的口粮，因为我本打算在回家之前“探索”一下。我还采购了一把精致的钢制实用刀和一把钢制斧头。我不确定我的旅程是否真的需要这么多，我很可能能够用它探索整个马基·埃亚尔，但我从未想象到，我在那个市场上买的东西在未来很快会起到什么作用。[/i]

从我的窗外，我看到城里许多居民跑去帮忙处理火灾。他们很快就开始封锁了这一地区，防止其进一步蔓延，但尽管他们努力灭火，许多房屋都在大火完全被控制之前被大火包围。不久，许多士兵赶到并推开了所有人，包括那些帮助灭火的居民。虽然火势还继续燃烧了一回儿，但它很快就开始减弱。我不知道他们是怎么做到的，但大火不久之后就完全熄灭了。也许是一些法师从藏身处出来，秘密地用水魔法把它扑灭了？很难想出其他的解释。

当火势开始熄灭时，一些士兵转移到被烧毁的房子里，搜寻那些没有从大火中逃脱的人。在那之后，他们继续调查起火的那栋楼。我注意到在一些士兵进入大楼后，他们拿出了几捆裹着毯子的包裹。我后来知道，这些包裹是那些引发火灾的嫌疑犯的遗骸。无论是意外还是故意，他们都是被自己的纵火行为烧死的。我知道那些被烧死的人包括一个人类，两个半身人和一个矮人。我很高兴，我及时离开了那个信使身边。

这段时间我一直呆在房间里。当我最后离开时，我和店主谈了这件事，得知这栋楼是收容许多从难民手中没收的财物的地方。当我离开旅馆时，我能听到街上许多居民的谈话，他们谈论着仓库里几乎每一件魔法物品都被摧毁了。他们还嘟囔着说，附近一些住户，还有几名最初前来帮忙灭火的居民也被大火烧死了。

在我去纳格尔市场的路上，人们不断地谈论这场火灾。甚至在那里，也有许多商人和顾客们正在继续谈论这一事件。在我买完东西后，突然间，我注意到了另一位顾客，他正在讨论难民们是多么的不安。我转过身去接近那位顾客说：“难民们为什么会心烦意乱呢？”这位顾客是一个半身人，穿着相当漂亮的衣服，但看起来很普通，转过身来，一脸惊愕地看着我。我叹了口气，很快就说：“是的，我是自然精灵，难民怎么了。”“你真的是，”半身人很快就说：“我不知道他们为什么这么不高兴。我以为他们会满足于得到食物和饮水，以及被允许在城市里搭起那些可怜的帐篷。可是，刚才的火灾的事情似乎把他们惹火了。”

那半身人停止说话，抬起头来关切地看着什么东西，然后转过身，突然跑了起来。在半身人逃跑时，我很快就听到身后的喊声。我转过身来，看到一大群衣衫褴褛的难民从摊位里冲了进来，商人们开始逃跑。在难民们从他们身边经过时，木头被砸碎了，布也被撕破了。我朝相反的方向离开了他们，但是那些走不开的顾客和商人被暴民撞倒和践踏。一些人试图反抗暴民或保护他们的摊位，结果也被推到在地上被打得遍体鳞伤。

在这种情况持续了几分钟后，第一批赶到的警卫终于恢复了秩序。卫兵们花了几分钟才集合起来，难民们继续在里面捣毁大量的市场。当警卫们最终搬进来清理时，许多难民四散，到处都是瓦砾、受伤的商人和顾客。当现场的秩序终于恢复时，一些卫兵来询问我是否没事，紧接着，其中一个卫兵把我拉到一边审问，问我发生了什么事。我把我所看到的事情都告诉了警卫。在我说完我的情况后，他们示意我离开这个地区。

离开市场后，我难以想象，如果我继续留在纳格尔王国，我还会看到怎样混乱的景象。虽然我侥幸躲过了危险，但下一次在那个市场上被践踏和撞倒的可能就是我了。我决定从城市大门离开这里返回。当我朝大门走去的时候，我注意到前面聚集着一群难民，甚至还有一些市民。我本该从他们身边走过，但在他们身后，我听到一个声音在上面响起。“现在就是采取行动的时候了，我们必须把矛头指向那些幕后黑手的源头，”听到这些话时我停下脚步，转过头。似乎有某种东西在迫使我留下来，听那个人所说的话。我被那声音吸引，开始向人群的边缘走去。]], "_t")

t([[[i]Was it anger against magic that drove people to the acts of violence against mages in the aftermath of the Spellblaze or was it perhaps something else? While I can't say I am an expert on the humans, halflings, or dwarves; the depravity I would witness on the street leading out of the Nargol Kingdom would go beyond what I would expect to have been possible for any sentient being to do.[/i]

As I peered in the voice rang out again. "Aimlessly your anger is directed against those who do not deserve it, I say direct it against the source of all the tragedies that have been inflicted" I began to push my way through the crowd, wondering who was speaking or what they were speaking about. The voice continued, "Wherever magic is found, it will eventually fail and bring calamity. The fire from this morning was an example of this, as a bunch of refugees broke into the warehouse where their confiscated magical items were stored to retrieve them. In their hubris they burned down the building with the arcane powers found within the items therein."

Making my way towards the middle, I looked up to see a halfling and a human facing out to the crowd. They wore a couple of masks that hid their identities, but I recognized the dark cloak worn by the human. Judging from the fact that human was raising his arms I assumed he was speaking, though I can't say for sure as the masks they wore covered their facial expressions. The voice began again "The results of the fire killed many of the residents sleeping within their houses nearby, more lives killed by magic. The only good thing that can be said of the incident was that many of those same magical items they sought to take were destroyed in the ensuing fire, no longer staining the world with their taint.

Within my mind the words of the voice pierced through my head, I could feel the anger behind the voice as it continued to speak. I saw those around me being swayed by both the words spoken and emotions behind them. Many beginning to say such things as 'magic is to blame' and 'down with magic' as the voice continued again "Of course, you need not be told about the devastation you have already seen firsthand. Much like the actions that led to the warehouse being burned down, it was the shaloren mages that unleashed the destruction that ravaged the lands and warped the skies. It is as I continue to say, wherever magic is found it, it will eventually fail and bring calamity."

The voice began to speak faster and with more passion as it continued on. "There can be no denying that we would be better off free from the effects of magic, lest we see these calamities continue to repeat. The Nargol Regents will take no action against the halflings within this city in their searches. If we are to protect our world, we will have to take up the task ourselves. Any artefact or item with even a hint of magical nature must be identified and promptly destroyed to prevent it from causing harm. We must also see to it that those who practice or who have any connection to the deplorable activities of the arcane are dealt with as well, lest they trigger another catastrophe in their arrogance."

By this point the crowd was beginning to chant such phrases as 'destroy the arcane', 'kill the spellcasters', and 'end the magic arts'. I myself was also beginning to feel the sentiment too, though resisted the urge to join in. Soon the voice began to issue instructions, demanding wood be brought into the street, and justice be enacted. The crowd began to disperse through the nearby buildings, and they began to pile the wood on the ground. More masked individuals began to step forward, carrying stakes of wood on their shoulders as well as large bundles of rope. I was puzzled as stakes of wood were erected towards the sky within the piles of wood that had been raised.

While the wood was being placed, the voice began to give out names of those suspected of magical wrongdoing within the city. A new instruction was given to bring them here, along with any magical items that could be found. Before long groups of the crowd made their way into houses and even into tents of the refugees, bringing back many of those I had assumed to be named. Those being brought cried out as they were dragged on the ground in confusion and terror. The voice then instructed that they be tied to the stakes of wood that had been erected and their magical items cast at their feet. Hearing this, the crowd immediately grabbed the rope and individuals were bounded by their hands and feet to the wood.

As if guided by some twisted force, accusations of magical wrongdoings were made by the masked individuals against those who were bound. Sometimes certain items were picked up, and by some warped practice they were made to produce sickly glows. Those deemed guilty by the crowd were kicked and beaten, unable to defend themselves as they remain bound to the stakes. Before long, a couple of those individuals wearing masks came forward with unlit torches. It was at this point I began to realize what the wood was for, as the torches were lit and began to dance with flame. What happened next I still remember vividly in my mind, as if burned by the thrown torches that glided through the air and the searing flames that spread across the wood.

The burning victims immediately began to let loose a torrent of screams as the smoldering heat crawled up their bodies and their skin began to blacken and burn. As this was happening I could hear the voice who had stirred the people around me to these brutal acts let loose a wretched cry that echoed through my head. The rest of the crowd followed suit, their symphony of cries building in a crescendo to the point that they were the only ones heard as their victims slowly ceased to live. I remember retching uncontrollable as I staggered away to the side of a building.

The horribleness of the act truly sickened me to my very being, but I was perhaps more sickened by what the voice would come to say next. "You all have done well, but it will take more than this to make our world safe" the voice said. "If you wish you can join me in the fight for nature and we can ensure that arcane forces like those that have brought us misery will never threaten the world again. Find me and be welcomed as a new initiate for our cause to save Eyal." I remember that I could see many of the masked individuals disappear into the crowds at this point, their aims achieved. I would come to learn very quickly as well just how much of an impact there words would have on that mob in front of me too.

A group of the Nargol Guards would eventual appear and they began to gather themselves to disperse the crowd and restore order. The crowd offered little resistance to the encroaching force of guards that rushed forward, and many fled into the dark alleys of buildings or through the tents of the refugees. As the guards took control of the area, their attention turned towards the simmering fire and the charred corpses. Cries of anguish came from individuals who I assumed to be loved ones and friends of those killed. At this point I could take no more of the events that were unfolding in front of me, and I turned to leave the area and the fiery carnage that had taken place. However as I passed by a tent a hand reached out of its opening, throwing me inside.]], [[[i]是对魔法的愤怒，驱使人们在魔法大爆炸后对法师施暴，还是其他原因？虽然我不能说我是人类、半身人或矮人的专家，但我在通往纳格尔王国的街道上看到的暴行所展现出的堕落，超出了我对任何智慧生物的预期。[/i]

当我凝视时，声音又响起了。“你的怒火漫无目的地指向那些不应该被谴责的人，大家，请把你们的怒火指向造成所有悲剧的万恶之源”我开始在人群中挤过去，想知道谁在说话，他们在说什么。声音继续说：“无论在哪里发现魔法，它最终都会失败并带来灾难。今早发生的火灾就是一个例子，一群难民闯进仓库，试图取回他们被没收的魔法物品。因为他们的狂妄，他们烧毁了这座建筑。在残余的物品中发现了奥术力量。”

我朝中间走去，抬头看见一个半身人和一个人正对着人群。他们戴了两个面具，隐藏了他们的身份，但我认出了人类穿的深色斗篷。从人类举起手臂的事实来看，我认为应该是他在说话，但我不能肯定，因为他们戴的面具遮住了他们的面部表情。声音又开始了：“这场大火在睡梦中杀死了许多住在附近房子里的居民，更多的人被魔法杀死。对于这起不幸的灾难，唯一可以说是好事的事情是，他们试图拿走的许多同样的魔法物品在随后的大火中也被焚毁，这些邪恶的物品再也不会玷污这个世界。”

在我的脑海里，声音的话语穿透了我的头脑，随着他继续说下去，我能感觉到声音后面的愤怒。我看到周围的人也被他们说的话和背后的情感所左右。很多人开始高叫着：“法师就是一切的罪魁祸首”和“消灭所有魔法”这样的话，声音又在继续，“当然，你也亲眼见到了魔法所带来的一切灾难。就像刚才导致仓库被烧毁的原因一样，是永恒精灵法师发动了魔法大爆炸，摧毁了土地，扭曲了天空。正如我刚才说的，无论在哪里有魔法，它最终都会失败并带来灾难。”

那人继续说了下去，说话的速度越来越快，越来越有激情。“不可否认，我们必须摆脱魔法的影响，以免我们看到的这些灾难继续重演。纳格尔摄政者在搜寻时不会对这座城市内的半身人采取任何行动。如果我们要保护我们的世界，我们就必须自己承担这个任务。任何带有魔法性质的神器或物品都必须被识别并立即销毁，以防造成伤害。我们还必须确保那些学习魔法，或者与可悲的奥术魔法活动有任何联系的人都被清洗，以免他们在傲慢中引发另一场灾难。”

这时，人群开始大喊“摧毁奥术魔法”、“杀光法师们！”和“结束一切魔法！”。我自己也开始感受到这种情绪，尽管我拒绝了加入的冲动。很快，这个声音开始发出指令，要求把木头运到街上，并开始审判。人群开始在附近的建筑物中散开，他们开始把木头堆在地上。更多戴面具的人开始向前走，肩上扛着木桩和一大捆绳子。我感到困惑，因为那些木桩被摆在地上的木头堆上，高高树立朝向天空。

当木头被放置完毕后，那个声音开始报出城市里那些被怀疑有行使魔法的人的名字。他颁布了新的指示，要把他们带到这里，并且带来所有能找到的魔法物品。不久，成群结队的群众在城市里集结，冲进民房，甚至冲进难民的帐篷，带回了许多名单上的难民。那些被带来的人在混乱和恐惧中从地上被拖了过来，大声喊叫。然后。这个声音指示把他们绑在竖立的木桩上，把他们的魔法物品扔在脚下。听到这话，人群立即抓住绳子，把他们手脚绑在木头上。

好像被某种扭曲的力量引导着，蒙面人对那些被捆绑的人，提出了各种有关使用魔法的恶行的指控。他不时捡起地上的魔法物品，使用某种扭曲方式，让它们发出病态的光芒。那些视为有罪的人被群众踢了又打却无法自卫，因为他们仍然被束缚在柱子上。不久，其中几个戴着面具的人拿着未点燃的火把走了出来，他们点燃了火把，火焰随之起舞，就在这时，我开始意识到木头是用来干什么的。随着被扔在空中的火把将灼热的火焰蔓延到了木桩上，接下来发生的一切，我一直清楚地记在我的脑海里。

当灼热的热气爬上他们的身体，他们的皮肤开始变黑和燃烧时，火刑的受害者立即开始发出一连串痛苦的尖叫。当这一切发生的时候，我能听到一个声音，这个声音激起了我周围的人对这些残忍的行为放声呐喊，在我的脑海中回荡。其他的人群也跟着他们呐喊着，他们的高叫声逐渐增强，以至于在看着受害者慢慢死去的过程中，我只能听到他们的叫喊声。我记得，当我摇摇晃晃地走到一栋楼的边上时，我无法控制自己，大量呕吐起来。

这种可怕的行为确实让我感到无比恶心，但更让我感到恐惧的是接下来的声音。“你们都做得很好，但要使我们的世界安全，我们还需要更多的努力，”那个声音说道：“如果你愿意，你可以和我一起为自然而战，我们可以确保，像刚才那些给我们带来痛苦的奥术力量使用者，永远不会再次威胁世界。加入我们，成为我们拯救埃亚尔的事业的新兵吧！”我看到许多蒙面人在此时消失在人群中，他们的目标实现了。我很快就会明白，这些话对我面前的暴徒也会产生多大的影响。

一群纳格尔王国的卫兵最终出现了，他们开始聚集起来驱散人群，恢复秩序。人群对冲锋而来的卫兵几乎没有抵抗力，许多人逃到建筑物的黑暗小巷或难民的帐篷里。卫兵控制了这一地区，他们的注意力转向了熊熊燃烧的大火和烧焦的尸体。那些看上去是被杀者的亲人和朋友的人，发出了痛苦的哭声。此时此刻，我再也无法忍受眼前发生的一切，我转身离开了这片区域，离开了那场发生在我面前的火热的大屠杀。然而，当我经过一个帐篷时，一只手伸出帐篷的开口，把我抓了进去。]], "_t")

t([[[i]I'm told that what I likely witnessed in the tent was the result of a psionic slaver. Using my own psyche against me, a manifested image of my own thoughts emerged for which the slaver could use against me. I had been lucky as I had managed to free myself from the slaver's hold, dispelling the image. Had I not done so, it was entirely possible that I could have become enthralled to the slavers will and made to do their bidding unquestioningly.[/i]

I hit the ground hard as I landed towards the back of the tent. Dazed I began to stand to look up at who had thrown me, coming face to face with one of the masked individuals, who I assumed helped take part in the event I had just seen. Slowly a hand reach up to remove the mask, revealing the face of the human messenger. He began to laugh before finally speaking and saying, "Fancy meeting you here, I knew I saw something in you when we conversed in the inn." The messenger laughed some more while I got up. I must have been in a bit of shock from the impact as my vision seemed fuzzy and hazy, while the things in the tent seemingly blurred together. Demandingly I responded to the messenger, “What to you want, why have you thrown me in here?"

The messenger stopped laughing and a calm smile appeared on his face, "Because I would like to have words with you, of course. What were you doing when you came here, when you came to the Nargol Kingdom?" I froze at those words, wondering how much danger I was in. The messenger stood unnaturally silent, his eyes seemingly reading me as thoughts of what to say flew through my mind. I stuttered in fright "I-I was del-livering some med-i-cal aid for th-the Nargols to us-e." A hard blow then struck my face as the messenger slapped me, sending me reeling to the side of the tent. The messenger stated in a raised voice “Indeed," before turning his head to shout at me saying "FROM THE Shaloren!"

Taking a step forward the messenger gave me a hard kick to the stomach, the force winding me and causing me to fall to the ground. I soon received another kick with the back of the heel to my face, causing blood to stream out. Bending down and picking me up by my hair the messenger drew me close to his face, spitting in it with both his saliva and his words, "I had thought better of you since you killed that Eldoral halfling. I figured you might be a fellow ally of nature, but that isn't the case, is it? You made it down to those shaloren, beyond that little wall of magic smoke they put up to hide themselves from us. You could have carried out a small portion of nature's wrath, but instead of enacting nature's fury you turned your back on it AND SIDED WITH THOSE WHO UNLEASHED THE SPELLBLAZE ON US!"

Crying now I was sobbing tears that mixed with the blood coming out of my face. Between sobs I quickly stated, "Enough pain has been felt already without adding to it-" before my head was abruptly smashed into the ground by the messenger. He yelled back "NO AMOUNT OF PAIN, FAY, WILL MAKE UP FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE! Every last one of those shaloren deserves to die. To die as painfully as those we burned-." The messenger continued to rant, but hearing my name called I stopped to think, ignoring the rest of what he had to say. How did he know my name? I never gave it to him, to anyone in the Nargol Kingdom, or even any of the shaloren for that matter. "How do you know my name?" I said to the messenger.

His ranting cut off immediately as the messenger looked down at me before replying, "Whatever do you mean Fay, you told me your name back at when, when-." Abruptly the messenger stopped talking, and seemingly the facial expressions seemed to fade away, leaving a faceless humanoid. I didn't know what was going on but knew then this was an imposter. I could feel an anger within me, and with my hand I grabbed whatever it was that I had been talking to. It struggled to keep a hold of me, trying to keep me down, but being closer to the ground I managed to pull it down with me. With my other hand I pulled back and began to punch at its head, until it seemingly faded from existence.

I began to regain vision of my surroundings and looking around I noticed the human with the dark cloak. I quickly realized this was the same human who had briefly visited the messenger when I was talking to him in the inn, as well as the one who stood in the center of the crowd and likely instigated the barbaric display outside. Getting up I said again, "Who are you really?" The figure began to back up in the direction of the tent opening, as if to escape now that I was free of whatever had been done to me. Moving to chase the fiend before he fled out of the tent, I began to run towards the opening. I don't know what happened next but the next moment I found myself face down on the ground.

I was pinned to the ground, unable to move or speak. Attempting to look at what was above me I noticed a halfling, likely the same one that had been standing with the human in the crowd. The human stopped moving away and after a brief moment of surveying the situation came up to stand next to me. As the human hovered over me he stated, "That was quite unexpected, you must have some impressive willpower to resist me thalore. I'm afraid though that if I can't bend you to my will then I am going to have to kill you." As the words trailed off, the human reached with one hand into its cloak, pulling out a small dagger with which I assumed to kill me.

I jostled around attempting to break free of the halfling’s hold, yet somehow despite the halfling’s smaller size than my own I could not break free, and he was doing this with just one arm. Taking the dagger in hand, the human pulled back and then thrust forward to finish me off. I was sure I would be killed, but in the next instant I noticed the dagger tumbling in the air. A bit confused at this, it would take me a moment to realize that the halfling that was holding me down had prevented the human from killing me. Seemingly as confused as me, the human seemingly look at the halfling with disbelief. Finally coming to his senses, the human finally regained his composure to ask the simple question on both of our minds. "What are you doing?"]], [[[i]我听说我在帐篷里看到的可能是一个灵能奴役者。他们能利用我自己的心理对抗我，奴役者创造了一个我的意识构成的形象，用来对付我。我很幸运，因为我设法摆脱了奴役者的控制，驱散了这个形象。如果我没有这样做，我完全有可能被奴役者的意志所吸引，毫无疑问地服从他们的命令。[/i]

我跌入帐篷里，重重地摔在地上。我被撞击搞的头晕目眩，开始站起来抬头看是谁在拉我，发现和我面对面的是其中一个蒙面人，那个蒙面人应该参与了我刚才所目睹的事件。蒙面人慢慢地一只手向上伸去揭开面具，露出了人类信使的脸。他笑了起来，最后开口说：“想不到在这里遇见你，我知道，我们在客栈交谈时，我看到了你身上的某些东西。”我起身时，信使又笑了几声。我的视线一片模糊，帐篷里的东西看起来模糊不清，我想我一定是受到了一些冲击。我问使者说：“你要什么，为什么把我拉到这里？”

信使不再笑了，脸上露出平静的笑容，“因为我当然想和你谈谈。当你来到这里，当你来到纳格尔王国的时候，你在做什么？”我被那些话吓住了，不知道自己有多危险。信使站在那里，不自然地保持沉默，他的眼睛似乎在阅读我的思想，阅读我脑子里闪过的该说什么的念头。我吓得结结巴巴地说：“我——我正在给纳格尔王国送去一些医疗救助。”突然，信使扇了我一巴掌，我的脸受到了沉重的打击，我摇摇晃晃地走到帐篷边上。送信人提高嗓门说：“是的”，然后转过头对我喊道：“从永恒精灵那里来！”

信使向前迈了一步，狠狠地踢了我一下肚子，我因为这股剧痛摔倒在地。他很快又踢了我一脚，脚踩在我的脸上，鲜血向下流出。信使弯下腰来，抓起我的头发，把我拉近他的脸，把唾沫吐在我的脸上，说道：“自从你杀了那个艾德瑞尔半身人，我就更想念你了。我想你可能是大自然的盟友，但事实并非如此，对吧？你到了那些永恒精灵那里，进入了他们为躲避我们而竖起的那堵魔法烟墙。你本可以对他们释放自然的愤怒，但你没有贯彻自然的愤怒，而是背弃了它，你站在了那些导致了魔法大爆炸的人一边！”

我哭着，抽泣着，眼泪和从我脸上流出的血混在一起。我抽泣着说：“他们已经感觉到了足够的痛苦，没有必要对它们施加更多的痛苦了。”然后，我的头突然被信使砸在地上。他喊道：“菲，再多的痛苦也弥补不了他们所做的一切！永恒精灵中的每一个人都应该死。就像我们烧死的人一样，痛苦地死去——”使者继续咆哮，但听到我的名字，我停下来思考，忽略了他要说的其他话。他怎么知道我的名字？我从来没有告诉过他，也没有告诉过纳格尔王国的任何人，甚至没有告诉过永恒精灵中的任何人。”你怎么知道我的名字？”我对信使说。

信使低头看了我一眼，然后回答说：“你是什么意思，菲，你以前告诉过我你的名字，在，在——”信使突然停止说话，他的面部表情消失了，留下了一个面目全非的人形。我不知道发生了什么，但我知道这是个骗子。我能感觉到内心的愤怒，我用手抓住我刚才对话的人。他挣扎着抱住我，试图把我压下去，但由于离地较近，我设法把他拉了下来。我用另一只手往回拉，开始打他的头，直到他消失了。

我开始重新看清周围的环境，环顾四周，我注意到了那个穿着深色斗篷的人类。我很快意识到，这就是我在客栈和信使谈话时短暂拜访过的那个人，也是站在人群中间，很可能是煽动外面的野蛮私刑的那个人。我又站起来说：“你到底是谁？”这个人影开始向帐篷开口的方向后退，好像是要逃走，因为我已经摆脱了他对我所做的一切。在这个恶棍逃出帐篷之前，我想要追他，而向帐篷开口跑去。然而，不知道接下来发生了什么，但下一刻我发现自己脸朝下趴在地上。

我被压在地上，动弹不得，也说不出话来。我试着看看上面的东西，在我身上压着一个半身人，很可能就是和那个人类站在一起蛊惑群众的那个半身人。那个人类停止了移动，调查了一小会儿情况，然后走到我的身边，说道：“这真是出乎意料，你一定有某种令人印象深刻的意志力来抵抗我，自然精灵。但我担心，如果我不能让你服从我的意愿，我就不得不杀了你。”当说完这句话后，那个人类一只手伸进斗篷，拔出一把小匕首，我想是用来杀我的。

我推推搡搡着试图挣脱半身人的束缚，但不知怎么的，尽管半身人比我自己的体型小，我还是无法挣脱，而他只用一只胳膊就固定住了我。那个人类拿着匕首向后，接着向前刺去，准备把我杀掉。我确信自己很快就要丧命了，但在接下来的一瞬间，我发现匕首弹飞出去，在空中翻滚。困惑许久，我才意识到，那个压着我的半身人阻止了人类杀死我。人类不相信地看着半身人，似乎和我一样困惑。终于，他恢复了镇定，醒悟过来，问了我们两个心里共同的问题。“你在干什么？”]], "_t")

Despite this though, burning events and other depraved actions would begin to be taken up by the citizenry itself. The messengers may have been killed, but the message they spread persisted.[/i]

Abruptly before giving the halfling even a moment to respond, the human seemingly began raving at the halfling saying, "You don't seriously mean to spare her? She's in league with the Shaloren, she's in league with magic!" The humans tone progressively got more emotional as the tirade continued, "Have you forgotten our mission and what we are charged to do. This THALORE has turned HER BACK on NATURE! She Must Di-" The human stopped talking as the halfling raised a hand up in a motion to stop and in a deeper tone than what I would expect from someone of such a small size, calmly replied back, "Enough." The human’s body shrank back at this, and though masked I could sense the disbelief and dismay from the body language.

The halfling put down the hand before finally responding with an explanation, stating, "Our mission is to root out the foul practitioners of the arcane and to make sure no further tragedies occur from magic's failings." The halfling took a deep breath before continuing to say, "This thalore is no spellcast-." The human abruptly cut off the halfling from speaking to yell with great fury, "SO WHAT!? She has associated with the Shaloren! THE ONES WHO CAUSED THE SPELL-" Once again the halfling put up a hand and again the human ceased to talk. Finally silent, the halfling put down the hand and I slowly felt some of the pressure on me relax. Somewhat tensely, the human finally turned away in disgust before heading towards entrance to the tent.

As the human left, I could feel the halfling proceed to get off of me and step away. Slowly I made to get up as the halfling turned its head to look in my direction. As I came to my feet I decided to ask, "Who are you really?" Turning its body fully towards me, the halfling seemingly paused a moment before answering me, "Do you wish to truly know?" It was my turn to pause as this question was put to me. These fanatics had been responsible for the sickening spectacle that I had witnessed outside. I was also now angry due to my treatment within the tent, now seemingly driving me to seek out an explanation. Finally replying to the halfling I replied, "I want to know why."

The halfling remained silent, emotions covered by the mask, and body language indicating nothing to me either. The only thing I could tell about the halfling was the military attire being worn. I noticed what seemed like a complete set of leather armor with gloves and boots included. Seemingly we merely stood looking at each other not saying anything. Was the halfling perhaps looking for something within me? I don't know. What I can tell you with each passing moment I was becoming angrier and more full of rage inside. Having enough of the silence and wanting my answer, I was about to begin shouting before at last the halfling stated, "Because nature has suffered enough, has it not?"

The sentence that was uttered struck deeply. I was immediately reminded of the reasons I had headed down to Elvala, of the rage and anger that had driven me to make the journey. But the actions of these masked individuals seemed less about exacting revenge for the wrong done to nature. No, it seemed closer to a vendetta against magic, and with the Spellblaze came an excuse to kill the practitioners of magic and destroy their works. Regaining my composure I replied, “Does that justify killing the innocent?" To this I could feel a dark emotion rise from the halfling. I had truly hit a nerve within the halfling. In the instant after that though, all I could feel was pain.

I didn't even see the halfling move, before I felt the punch connect with my stomach. Looking down I saw the halfling below just as a fist connected with the bottom of my jaw. Stunned by the blow I stumbled a bit before falling down. Now looking up at the halfling, I could see the rage emanating towards me, towards the words I had just uttered. "Innocent? There is no innocence in those who pervert nature and her design. There can be no forgiveness for them either." I should have been afraid of the halfling at this point, but the anger inside me fueled me to go forward. As I got to my feet I fired back, "Does that justify the atrocious display I saw outside then? To take random people from their homes, charge them with what you see as wrongdoings, and then execute them in a fiery display?"

The halfling dropped to a less hostile stance and replied, "If you are referring to the people we named, then know that they were all defilers of nature. Potion brewers, runemasters, a blacksmith who specialized in magical artefact creation, and more than a dozen mages capable of casting spells. We have done great care in identifying various users who twist nature to their whims..." The halfling trailed off to take a breath before continuing with the final sentence. "As for how we killed them, a message needs to be sent, to be seared into the hearts and minds of the citizens of this city and elsewhere. Perhaps you may not have the stomach for it, if so I suggest you go back to your little forest thalore. This won't be the last display you will likely see."

I don't know what made me more angry at that point, the seemingly callous nature of the halfling or the suggestion to simply go back home. What I did know was that I was livid. Seemingly the halfling noticed this and tried to reorient its posture. Attempting to redirect my anger, the halfling quickly opined, "Of course, you seem like you are made of sterner composition than most. Head to the south shoreline, then turn east. You'll find a path leading towards our base." Registering the words I took a moment to analyze them in my head, before asking, "And why should I do that?" Without missing a beat the halfling quickly replied back, "You wish to know why, do you not? Go talk to our instructors if you truly wish to know who we are."

With this the halfling turned to leave the tent. The anger within me had not subsided much, but I made no further attempt to confront the halfling. Battered and bruised I sank down to the ground and rested a moment. Pulling one of the infusions I had recently purchased from the market, I began to treat my wounds. When I felt I was in better shape I got up again and left the tent. Looking up I noticed the evening sky, and decided that I would be staying one more night in the Nargol Kingdom. I made my way back to the inn where I slept in a bed until the next day. When I left I headed straight to the gates of the city to make my way out. There I pondered where my next destination would be, before finally heading south.]], [[[i]过了一段时间，纳格尔王国似乎抓住了我所目睹的那些扭曲事件的幕后黑手，而在我离开后，更多的事情接踵而至。他们公开处决了那些他们认为是罪魁祸首的人，并把头埋在城墙内的木桩上。尽管如此，市民开始自发发动火刑事件和其他各种堕落行为。信使的同伙们可能已经被杀了，但他们传播的信息仍然存在。[/i]

在半身人还没有来得及回应之前，人类开始对半身人大吼道：“你不是真的想饶了她吗？她是和永恒精灵一伙的，是和魔法一伙的！”，人类的语气变得越来越情绪化，“你是否忘记了我们的使命，忘记了我们要做的事情。这个自然精灵已经背叛了大自然！她必须被…”人类突然停止了说话，只见半身人举起一只手示意停下，用比我对这么小个儿的人所期望的更深沉的语调，平静地回答说：“够了。”人类一下子退缩了，虽然他戴着面具，但我能感觉到他身体语言的不信任和沮丧。

半身人放下手，最后做出解释，说：“我们的任务是铲除邪恶的奥术使用者，并确保不再因为魔法的失败引发悲剧。”半身人深吸一口气，然后继续说，“这个自然精灵不是施法者——”人类突然打断了半身人的说话，愤怒地喊道，“那又怎样！？她和永恒精灵有联系！那些引起魔法大——“半身人再一次举起手来，人类再一次停止说话。四周一片寂静，半身人放下了手，我慢慢感觉到了对我的压力稍稍放松了一些。在紧张的气氛中，人类终于厌恶地转过身去，然后走向帐篷的入口。

在人类离开后，我能感觉到半身人从我的身上起来，走开了。我慢慢地站起来，半身人转过头看着我的方向。在我站起来后，决定问：“你到底是谁？”半身人把身子完全转向我，似乎停了一会儿才回答我：“你真的想知道吗？”当被问到这个问题之后，我了停下来。这些狂热分子对我在外面看到的令人作呕的景象负有责任。而我在帐篷里的待遇也让我充满了愤怒，但这愤怒现在似乎驱使我寻找一个解释。最后我回答半身人说：“我想知道为什么。”

半身人保持沉默，他的面具掩盖着情绪，肢体语言对我也毫无意义。关于半身人，我唯一能说的就是他所穿的军装。我注意到他好像穿着一套完整的皮甲，包括手套和靴子。我们似乎只是站在那里看着对方，什么也没说。那个半身人是不是在找我内心的东西？我不知道。我能告诉你的是，随着时间的流逝，我内心变得越来越愤怒。我受够了沉默，想要得到回答，我正要开始喊叫，这时半身人说：“因为大自然已经受够了，不是吗？”

我被那句话深深地打动了，我想起了我去埃尔瓦拉的原因，想起了驱使我踏上旅程的仇恨与愤慨。但这些蒙面人的所作所为，似乎并不是为了报复对自然的错误。不，这似乎更像是对魔法的仇杀，以魔法大爆炸作为借口，以此开展杀死魔法使用者并摧毁他们作品的恶行。我恢复了镇静，回答说：“难道为此滥杀无辜也是对的吗？”这时，我能感觉到一种黑暗的情绪从半身人身上升起。我真的戳到了那个半身人的弱点。在那之后的一瞬间，我所能感觉到的只是疼痛。

我甚至没看到半身人的动作，就感觉到一拳打在了我的肚子上。我向下看，看到下方的半身人又是一拳打中我的下巴。我被那一击震慑，跌跌撞撞地摔倒了。现在我抬头看那半身人，感受到他朝我释放的愤怒，不断朝着我刚才说的那些话涌来。“无辜？那些歪曲自然和她的设计的人是没有清白的。他们也永远不能被原谅。”我本应该害怕半身人的，但我内心的愤怒促使我向前。当我站起身来时，我回击道：“那难道能证明，我当时在外面看到的残暴的表演是正当的？把无辜的人从他们的家里带走，指控他们做了你认为是错误的事，然后在火刑架上处决他们？”

半身人摆出了一个不那么敌对的姿态，回答说：“如果你指的是我们名单上的那些人，你就知道，他们都是自然的亵渎者。药水酿造师，符文师，一个专门制作魔法工艺品的铁匠，还有十几个能够施法的法师。我们非常小心地识别出各种各样的魔法使用者，他们把自然扭曲成自己的突发奇想……”半身人拖着脚步喘口气，然后继续念最后一句话。“至于我们如何杀死他们，我们需要发出一个信息，让这个城市和其他地方的市民铭记在心。也许你对它没有胃口，如果是这样的话，我建议你回到你的小森林去，自然精灵。这将不会是你可能看到的最后一次展示。”

我不知道是什么让我在那一点上更生气，是半身人冷酷无情的本性，还是他对我干脆回家的建议。我只知道我脸色发青。似乎半身人注意到了这一点，并试图调整自己的姿势。为了转移我的怒气，半身人很快地说：“当然，你看起来比其他人都要更加顽固。向南岸线走，然后向东拐。“你会找到一条通向我们基地的路。”我把这些话记在脑子里，想了一会儿，然后问，“我为什么要这么做？”半身人毫不迟疑地回答道：“你想知道为什么，不是吗？如果你真的想知道我们是谁，就去和我们的导师谈谈。”

说完，半身人转身离开帐篷。我内心的愤怒并没有平息太多，但我没有进一步尝试去面对那个半身人。我遍体鳞伤，倒在地上休息了一会儿。我拿出一只市场上买的纹身，开始治疗伤口。当感觉到自己的身体状况好了一些时，我又站起来离开了帐篷。抬头一看，我看到了夜晚的天空，决定在纳格尔王国再住一晚。我回到旅店，在那里我直睡到第二天。当我离开时，我直奔城门出去。在那里，我考虑了一下下一步的目的地，最后决定向南走。]], "_t")

t([[[i]Truly there was no place showing more damage in all of Eyal than its southern shoreline. Though I have not traveled to the eastern side of the continent, I can't imagine it potentially being destroyed to the extent that it has been here. These lands will never fully heal, but I do hope it will serve as a reminder the to Shaloren, to never brashly use magic in such a way again.[/i]

Following the travel instructions that I had received from the halfling, I proceeded south. I did not know why I didn't just travel north back home, something about the anger burning within me fueled me to find the instructors of these masked fanatics. As I traveled south the sky would begin to turn a shade of colors from blue to purple and then a blackish red, and before long I couldn't even see the sun anymore. There was no sign that any of the lands around me escaped the destructive energies of the Spellblaze here. Eventually after a full day of travel, I set up camp near some burnt out trees. There was little to forage for in the destroyed wilderness, but I was able to find some edible berries and mushrooms to feed myself with and save on my provisions.

The next day I continued on my journey. After a few hours I reached the southern shoreline, a grotesque sight to say the least. The waters bubbled as if being boiled and the ground was charred black. What trees or plants that still stood were completely burnt, dead and lifeless; as was the wildlife that had not escaped, their corpses left untouched by the bugs and worms. Looking up all I could see was dark clouds against a blackened sky. To the east I noticed small pools of lava escaping to the surface. Some of the lava formed small lakes or streams of red hot death which I cautiously had to avoid. Looking to the north I noticed the lands jaggedly shooting out unnaturally towards the sky.

Moving closer towards the raised landscape I noticed that they rose as high as a mountain in the distance. Climbing a hill I saw how the unnatural rocks formed twisting chasms and pointy spikes that would almost certainly be suicide to traverse. Remembering back to the shaloren soldiers I had treated in Elvala, I quickly realized why they had moved northwards to come home. The center of the continent where the Midvale Plains had been located were now no more. Now the plains had been replaced by this deadly gauntlet of rock that would certainly kill anyone inside it, and likely anyone who had been living on the plains before the Spellblaze.

Beginning to travel through the devastated landscape I had to be careful. As I made my way east the light of the sun was seemingly snuffed out by the smoke and debris of the area and the only way I could see my footing was from the glow of the nearby lava dotting the landscape. I don't know for how many days I would travel eastwards, but my progress though the lands was slow. Eventually I would see a river of lava flowing down to the open sea, and beyond that the burnt out remains of what I assumed was a forest. Seeing my way blocked, I looked north and noticed a clearing in the land and so I continued my way there to see if I could find safe passage.

I carefully made my way up the terrain to a plateau and saw a small opening appear in the jutted mountains up ahead. While the land I crossed was hilly, I was able to find decent footing through the lethal landscape of deadly drops and pitfalls. Slowly I made my way through, finding a path leading downwards into what I hope would lead to the other side. Suddenly though in the distance I could see the figure of a group advancing fast towards me. Drawing closer to me, one of the figures in the group saw me, yelled out to the others, and they slowed to a cautious crawl. As they approached, I was a bit of a miss as to what race these beings were.

They were tall, even taller than me, and I could see their bulging mass of muscles on their bodies from quite a distance away. Something also glistened on their skin, which as they grew closer I noticed to be glowing insignias similar to those I saw on runes in Elvala. Getting into earshot, one of the beings finally called out, "If you plan on taking us back, be prepared for a fight!" At that moment I realized that these were yet more victims of those masked fanatics. In a sign to show I wasn't hostile I put my belongings on the ground and stepped back from them. The action seemed to take the beings back a bit, and though still on edge they assumed a less aggressive stance.

"You aren't aligned at all with those zealots are you? My apologies for any distress we may have caused you." I merely shook me head as their words reached me, before proceeding to ask who they were and what had happened. "Never seen an ogre before I assume? We are, or we were, a nomadic tribe that wandered the lands as peddlers. Mostly we sold runes and infusions but we also sold other various small trinkets too. Then magic rained down from the sky and the earth opened up, destroying everything and killing many. We immediately went to help those we could in a nearby human city."

At this point tears began to stream down the ogres face. Continuing to speak between sobs the ogre continued, "I'm not sure why, but a small band attack us." At this point the ogre began to cry to the point that it was unable to speak, and seeing this another ogre continued, "We were bound in chains and taken to a small settlement just beyond this path. There we were subjected to insane experiments, something about 'cleansing us', and we witnessed a great many ogres die in grotesque and horrible ways. Realizing we would meet a similar fate we broke out of our bonds and made to escape from our cages." The ogre paused for a bit, looking behind me at the devastated landscape, then stated, "Although I'm not exactly sure where we may run to."]], [[[i]的确，在整个埃亚尔，没有一个地方比它的南部海岸线受到更大的破坏。虽然我还没有去过大陆的东边，但我无法想象它会被破坏到这样的程度。这里的土地永远不会完全愈合，我真的希望它能提醒人们，不要再以这种方式肆无忌惮地使用魔法。[/i]

按照半身人给我的旅行指示，我向南走去。我不知道为什么我不去北方回家，也许我内心的愤怒驱使我找到这些蒙面狂热者的导师。当我往南走的时候，天空开始从蓝色变成紫色，然后变成了暗红色，不久我甚至看不到太阳了。一切迹象表明，我周围没有任何一片土地逃脱了魔法大爆炸的侵袭。经过一整天的旅行，我终于在一些被烧毁的树旁安营扎寨。在被毁的荒野里，几乎没有什么可供觅食的东西，但我找到了一些可食用的浆果和蘑菇来养活自己，省下了我的粮食。

第二天我继续旅行。几个小时后，我到达了南部海岸，周围是一片怪诞的景象。水沸腾了，地面烧黑了。那些仍然屹立着的树木和植物被完全烧毁，死气沉沉；还有那些没有逃走的野生动物，它们的尸体里连虫子和蛆虫都没有。抬头一看，只见乌云密布在漆黑的天空中。在东面，我注意到有小的熔岩池溢出了地表。一些熔岩形成了小湖泊或炽热的死亡溪流，我不得不谨慎避开。往北望去，我注意到那些荒芜的土地不自然地向天空伸去。

向凸起的地貌走近时，我注意到它们像远处的一座山一样高。爬上一座小山，我看到了这些不自然的岩石是如何形成扭曲的裂缝和尖尖的尖刺的，想要穿越他们简直就是在自杀。回忆起我在埃尔瓦拉治疗过的永恒精灵士兵，我很快意识到他们为什么选择向北进军回家。米德瓦尔平原所在的大陆中心现在已经不复存在了。现在平原已经被这些致命的尖石所碾碎了，这个过程恐怕杀死了里面的所有人，很可能是在魔法大爆炸之前生活在平原上的任何物种。

开始穿越这片荒芜的土地时，我必须小心。当我往东走的时候，太阳的光芒似乎被这片区域的烟雾和碎片遮住了，唯一能让我看清自己脚下的，就是附近散布在这片土地上的熔岩的光辉。我不知道我会向东旅行多长时间，但我在这片荒芜土地上的旅程是极度缓慢的。最后，我看到一条熔岩河流入了公海，在那尽头，我看到了一片森林的烧尽的残骸。我觉察到路被堵住了，就往北看，注意到那里有一块空地，于是我继续往那儿走，看能否找到安全的通道。

我小心翼翼地向高原走去，看到前面突出的群峦中出现了一个小洞。虽然我穿越的土地是丘陵地带，但我成功地在致命的悬崖和峭壁的可怕景象中找到勉强可以立足的地方。我慢慢地走过去，找到了一条通向我希望通向的另一边的路。突然，我发现一个团体的身影正在向我快速前进，尽管还在远处。他们离我越来越近，其中一个人看见了我，向其他人高喊，他们放慢脚步，小心翼翼地前行。当他们走近时，我有点不明白这些家伙是什么种族的。

他们很高，甚至比我还高，我能从很远的地方看到他们身上隆起的肌肉。他们的皮肤上有着一些闪光的东西，当他们越来越近时，我注意到覆盖在他们身上的是闪光的纹样，和我在埃尔瓦拉的符文上看到的相似。在他们和我之间到了能够互相听到声音的时候，他们大声喊道：“如果你打算把我们带回去，就要做好和我们战斗的准备！”在那一刻，我意识到他们是那些蒙面狂热者的其他受害者。为了表示我没有敌意，我把我的东西放在地上，然后退后。这一举动似乎让他们后退了一点，尽管仍然和我对峙着，但他们采取了一种不那么咄咄逼人的姿态。

“你和那些狂热份子不是一伙的，对吗？我为我们可能给你带来的任何痛苦表示歉意。”听到他们的话，我摇了摇头，然后问他们是谁，发生了什么事。“看来你以前从没见过食人魔？我们是，或者说我们曾经是一个游牧部落，作为小贩在这片土地上游荡。我们主要卖符文和纹身，但我们也卖其他各种小饰品。突然间，魔法从天而降，大地裂开，摧毁了一切，杀死了许多人。我们立即前去帮助附近一个人类城市的人们。”

这时，泪水开始顺着食人魔的脸流下来。食人魔继续啜泣着说，“我不知道为什么，但是一只小队袭击了我们。”这时食人魔开始哭到说不出话来，另一个食人魔继续说，“我们被他们用铁链拷住，被带到了一个小定居点，就在这条路的另一边。在那里，他们在我们的身上进行了疯狂的实验，他们声称这是要“净化我们”。我们目睹了很多食人魔以怪异和可怕的方式死去。意识到我们会遇到类似的命运，我们挣脱了束缚，从笼子里逃了出来。“食人魔停了一会儿，看着我身后那片被毁坏的土地，然后说，“尽管，我们也不知道我们还能跑到哪里去。”]], "_t")

t([[[i]There is so little that is known of the ogres, and seemingly they know little of themselves either. This may have to do with my seclusion from the outside world, but I wonder if this race only recently came to Maj'Eyal? Viewing the Shaloren archives there is little mention of the ogres, and I don't believe even among the Thaloren we know much of them either. I wonder where the ogres truly come from?[/i]

I could feel the stares of the entire group looking past me, at the uninviting landscape. They did not know where they could run to, only to run. Looking to establish if it was indeed the masked fanatics they were running from I asked, "Did the zealots you speak of wear masks on their faces?" The ogres immediately locked their stares back on me, the tense fear in their eyes telling me that the zealots they spoke of and the masked fanatics I had encountered were one and the same. I immediately remembered the anger within me that I felt, knowing that these ogres were now facing the same sinister fanatics that had initiated those atrocities in the Nargol Kingdom that I had recently witnessed.

Immediately at that point I decided that if I could be of help to these victims of those madmen then I would. Remembering the Rune of Return that had been handed to me in Elvala I looked up and asked "If you follow me, I can lead you to Elvala. They have cut themselves off from the outside world, but I can get you inside the lands of the Shaloren where you will be safe." The ogres immediately looked up at me as I stated these words, though it appeared to be a look of shock and irritation more than anything else. "You would suggest we go to the Shaloren? Weren't they the ones behind this, this Spellblaze? We would be peacefully going about our lives if it wasn't for them turning the world upside down."

Keeping my calm I decided to try persuading the ogres to go to Elvala replying, "Where else might you go to survive?" To this I received several frowns, but one pondered the question and asked, "Would they even help us, would we even be safe?" I stopped for a moment at the first question that was asked before responding, "They are unable help the outside world as a result of the actions from those same zealots that captured you. However, I know that they feel deeply for what they have done and I believe they will offer you sanctuary if you go to them. If you have nowhere else to go then allow me to bring you to them to ask for shelter." As I finished I noticed one ogre staring back. Some of the ogres noticed this and looked to the ogre as well before asking, "Is it them?"

Carefully looking at the ogre I saw some sort of dark blue glow covering his eyes, as if allowing him to peer at something. Suddenly the ogre piped up all at once, "We need to move." All of a sudden I could see a grave expression take hold of every ogre in the group. One seemed to begin muttering in a panicked manner "what do we do" under their breath repeatedly. A bit confused at this I asked, “What is it?" The ogre who had been looking back quickly turned and came to me, looking deeply into my face with his eyes that had been glowing before, as if looking for something. Finally he stated in a deep ominous voice, "You better not be trying to deceive us thalore. Now, take us to Elvala. We need to move. NOW!"

Taken off guard by the abruptness of the demand I simply stammered out "O-O-kay-ee." The ogre not missing a beat called to the others, "Let's go!" Quickly he grabbed my arm and we began to run, the thunderous sounds of the other ogres soon following. Recklessly we seemed to charge through the deathtraps of the land, jumping small chasms and skirting past sharp rock. What had taken me what had seemed a day to traverse we seemingly traveled in an hour. The ogre that kept ahold of my arm and sometimes lifted me up to avoid the hazards on the ground. We continued to run until I could see the shoreline. Pointing out the western direction that we needed to go with my other arm, the group swiftly turned and we began dodging the patches of lava.

Beginning to pant and weave at this point, the ogre holding my arm finally began to slow down. Stopping he turned his head to look to our rear, the same dark blue glow appearing over his eyes once more. No longer content with my ignorance I finally asked what he was doing. The dark blue glow immediately faded as the ogre looked at me directly before giving a response. "I take it you aren't very well versed in runes, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised being how adverse you thaloren are to the arcane. I'm using a rune that grants me vision of what the terrain is like around me, though I'm not necessarily using it for that specific purpose right now." The ogre stopped talking for a moment to look back again.

Chiming in to continue the explanation another ogre stated, "He's looking back to see how far away those zealots chasing us from their encampment are. "We were being chased?" I suppose I shouldn't have expected any less from those magic hating fanatics. Likely they would very much want to recapture the ogres for whatever nefarious intentions they had. I began to recall the events I had recently witnessed them perpetrate and how I felt sick afterwards. I wondered what atrocities these ogres had suffered by their hands. Looking to stop myself from recalling anymore of those terrible memories I quickly pressed the ogre on how they knew we were being chased.

"To give you the short version, his vision rune is giving him the power to see the general location of the individuals pursuing us. There is a bit more to it than that but for our purposes he can get a pretty good glimpse of where those zealots following us are and how close they are relative our position." Rather impressed that the ogre could do that, I wondered what other feats the runes could allow the ogres to do. I figured when we were in relative safety that maybe I should ask the ogres a bit more about what their runes. Suddenly though I heard a curse, and turned to see the dark blue glowing eyes of the ogre now seemingly peering ahead us at something else.

Asking him what was wrong the dark blue glow went away from the ogres eyes and I quietly received the grave response, "There is a group of people in front of us, and there are definitely zealots among them too." At this the other ogres faces turned to a look of total dismay. I could hear the yelling from behind me. "What do we do now?" one said. "I don't want to go back" another would say. Cowardly words spewed from the mouth of a new ogre every moment until it seemed everyone in the group was erupting in fear. For a moment the sorry display continued until finally the ogre holding my arm let go and yelled to the others "ENOUGH OF YOUR SNIVELING!" The other ogres went silent at this, now looking up as if waiting for directions on what to do. ]], [[[i]我对食人魔所知甚少，似乎他们对自己也知之甚少。这可能与我与世隔绝有关，但我想知道，这些种族是不是最近才出现在马基·埃亚尔？我翻阅永恒精灵档案的时候很少提到食人魔，看来即使是在永恒精灵之中，他们也对食人魔了解不多。我想知道，食人魔到底是从哪里来的？[/i]

我能感觉到那群人的目光从我身边掠过，注视着那不引人注意的风景。他们不知道自己还能跑到哪里去，只能继续自己的逃亡。我问他们说：“你们所说的狂热者，脸上戴着面具吗？”食人魔的目光立刻紧盯着我，他们眼中的紧张恐惧告诉我，他们所说的狂热者和我遇到的蒙面狂热者是一模一样的。我立刻记起我内心的愤怒，因为我知道这些食人魔现在面对的正是我最近目睹的在纳格尔王国发动这些暴行的邪恶狂热者。

我立刻决定，一定要尽全力帮助这些疯子的受害者。我想起在埃尔瓦拉交给我的返回符文，抬起头问：“如果你跟着我，我可以带你去埃尔瓦拉。他们把自己与外界隔绝了，但我可以把你带到永恒精灵的土地里，在那里，你会安全的。”当我说这些话时，食人魔们立即抬头看着我，但他们的眼神看起来比任何其他东西都更令人震惊和恼怒。“你竟然建议我们去找永恒精灵？他们不是这一切的罪魁祸首吗？如果不是因为他们把世界搞得天翻地覆，我们的生活本来应该和平地继续下去。”

我尽力保持冷静，为了决定劝说那些食人魔去埃尔瓦拉，继续回答说：“如果不去那里，你还能去哪里生存呢？”对此，大部分人皱起了眉头，但有人想了想，问道：“他们真的会帮助我们吗，我们会安全吗？”我在回答第一个问题前停了一会儿，“因为那些俘虏你的狂热者在四处施展暴行，他们无法帮助外部世界。不过，我知道他们对自己所做的一切深感忏悔。我相信，如果你去他们那里，他们一定会给你提供庇护所。如果你无处可去，那就让我带你去他们那里寻求庇护吧。”当我说完的时候，我注意到一个食人魔好像在凝望着什么东西。一些食人魔注意到了这一点，在问“是他们吗？”

我仔细地看着那食人魔，看到一种深蓝色的光芒遮住了他的眼睛，仿佛这让他可以窥视到什么东西。突然，那只食人魔大声说：“我们必须得跑了。”一瞬间，我看到面前的每一位食人魔的脸上都浮现了严峻的表情。一个人似乎开始惊慌失措，不断低声咕哝着：“…我们该怎么办”。我有点困惑，问道：“这是什么？”一直在回头看的那只食人魔很快转过身来，向我走来，用他刚才一直发光的眼睛深深地望着我的脸，好像在寻找什么。最后，他用一种深沉而不祥的声音说：“你最好不要试图欺骗我们，自然精灵。现在，带我们去埃尔瓦拉。我们得走了。现在！”

突然的要求让我措手不及，我只是结结巴巴地说了一句“好吧，好吧。”食人魔瞬间反应过来，立刻对其他人说：“走吧！”很快他抓住我的胳膊，我们开始奔跑，其他食人魔以迅雷之势跟在身后奔跑起来。我们急切地冲破了这片土地上的死亡陷阱，跳过了小裂口，绕过了锋利的岩石。我们似乎只花了一个小时，就穿越了本来我要一天才能穿过的路程。食人魔抓住我的胳膊，不时把我举起来躲避地面上的危险。我们继续跑，直到我看到了海岸线。他们用另一只胳膊指出，我们需要往西边走，然后迅速转过身，开始躲避地上的熔岩块。

当我开始气喘吁吁，体力不支，那只抓住我手臂的食人魔终于开始放慢脚步。停下来，他把头转向我们的后方，同样的深蓝色光芒再次出现在他的眼睛上。我抑制不住好奇的心情，终于，我问他在做什么。那个食人魔直接看着我，然后做出回应时，深蓝色的光芒立刻消失了。“我认为你对符文不是很精通。我想我不应该惊讶于你们自然精灵有多么反对奥术力量。我使用的符文可以让我看到周围的地形，虽然我现在并非把它用于这个用途”那个食人魔停顿了一下，然后继续向远处看去。

另一个食人魔插嘴继续解释道：“他回头看看那些从营地追我们的狂热者有多远。”我们被追捕了？我想我不该对那些讨厌魔法的狂热者抱有任何期望。无论他们有什么邪恶的意图，看来现在他们非常想夺回食人魔。我开始回忆起我最近目睹的那些事件，那些即使到之后也让我感到无比恶心的事件。我无法想象，这些食人魔身上遭受了什么样可怕的暴行。为了不让自己再想起那些可怕的记忆，我很快地向那食人魔追问他们是怎么知道我们被追赶的。

“给你一个简短的答案，他的视野符文给了他一种力量，让他看到追捕我们的人的大致位置。实际情况更加复杂，但是他可以看清楚那些跟随我们的狂热者在哪里，他们与我们的位置有多接近，这对我们就足够了。”食人魔可以做到这一点令我印象深刻，我想知道符文还能让食人魔做些什么。我想，在我们相对安全的时候，也许我应该多问一下食人魔他们的符文是什么。突然，我听到一声咒骂，转过身来，看到那只深蓝色发光的食人魔的眼睛，现在似乎在我们前面窥视着别的东西。

当我问他出了什么问题时，深蓝的光芒从食人魔的眼睛里消失了，我静静地得到了严肃的回答：“我们面前有一打群人，他们当中肯定也有狂热者。”这时，其他食人魔的脸都转过头来，露出了完全沮丧的表情。我能听到身后的喊声。有人说，“我们现在该怎么办？”，另一个人说，“我不想回去！”。绝望的话语不断从每个食人魔嘴里喷涌而出，直到这群人在恐惧中爆发。有那么一瞬间，我以为这个沮丧的表演一直持续到最后，直到那只抓住我手臂的食人魔放开了我，对其他人喊道：“你们哭够了！”其他的食人魔迅速沉默了下来，抬起头来，好像在等待该做什么的指示。]], "_t")

t([[[i]I had never seen a battle before in my life, let alone been a part of one. However I do not believe this is necessarily the case for the ogres. They say that they lived as nomadic peddlers but I wonder if perhaps that was just a cover story for themselves. Maybe they hired themselves out as mercenaries or other such adventures of combat? It is hard to know what lies within their past.[/i]

Realizing the situation at hand, the ogre who had moments ago been holding my arm this entire time now took up the task of preparing the other ogres for the fight at hand. Stepping forward to address the others he quickly broke into a speech. "The enemy is on both sides of us, but we aren't trapped yet. Those behind us have to travel through the treacherous ground we had to pass through here ourselves and those ahead of us are still some distance away. We have time to form a plan and prepare for battle before either group arrives." As the ogre finished, one of the others soon piped up, "What will you have us do commander!" The newly minted commander grunted before replying, "First, we need a plan of attack."

To this another ogre stepped up and stated, "How fast is each group moving towards us, which one will be on us first?" At this the commander paused for a moment before taking a look in front and behind him at the two approaching groups. When he was finished he responded, "The ones behind us are closer, but it looks like they are only slowly navigating the landscape we crossed due to all the hazards. The other group is approaching at rapid speed. They will likely get to us first. Do you think we should hit the front group first, strategist?” I could see the strategist raise his head and smile a bit upon being named before stating, "Yes Sir! Maybe we can punch through them before getting hit in our rear?"

The commander nodded to this and then noted, "We don't have any weapons to fight with, but we can use the environment to our advantage. Knock them into hostile terrain, use choke points in the land to avoid being overwhelmed by their numbers, fight dirty and kick the blackened dirt into their faces." The commander stopped to take a breath before hollering "WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!" To this the other ogres hollered the same "WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!" Then all the ogres broke into a resounding roar as they raised both their arms and their voices, shaking their hands while making odd gestures with them, and completely showing no more signs of the craven display I had just witnessed of them moments ago.

I immediately notice the bigger ogres break off towards several dead trees, and with surprising ease ripped them from the ground. After breaking the branches and roots off they proceeded to swing the trunks around like giant clubs. More ingenious ogres ripped their clothing into careful strips. Taking their belts off they fashioned them together with the strips to construct crude slings. Other ogres collected rocks and piled them on the ground nearby, ammo I assumed for the slings. Other ogres seemed to pair off with each other and perform odd poses one after the other. When finished they would seemingly begin to punch and kick in the air, which I assumed was practice for fighting unarmed.

I stood awestruck at the sight of the ogres and their astounding ability to turn into a fighting force. I didn't even notice when the commander came up to me. Attempting to get my attention he loudly stated, "Thalore, Focus!" I snapped my head quickly in his direction. "Whaa-wha. What?" I stammered my words as I quickly zoned back into my immediate situation. "Do you have anything that can be used to help us out?" Registering the words of the ogre I quickly pulled my pack off my shoulders and reached in to display its contents. "This is all I have" I said. The commander peered into the bag, then reached in to grab the hatchet and the utility knife that I had purchased back in the Nargol Kingdom.

He weighed the two objects in each hand, then taking the hatchet he proceeded to take a few swings with it. Wearing a satisfied expression he handed the knife back to me saying "I can't use this, it's too small for my hands to use effectively. You take it and use it to defend yourself." Hearing those words I soon realized something, I would be in this fight. While I might have chased off a hungry animal or two, I didn't have any actual combat experience against a real foe. The commander seeing my discouraged face then stated, "That you have come this far I can tell you aren't with those zealots. If need be, just run and save yourself. They likely will let you go, it is us ogres they are after, not you."

The words pierced through me, making me quite angry. Shouting back at the Commander I responded, "No, I will fight with you." I'm not sure if it was the anger within me that caused me to say those words, but I knew that I would not let the ogres fight alone. I might die in the fight but I would not run from it. To this the commander and the other ogres quickly glanced in my direction, surprised but nonetheless happy. One ogre gave a cheerful shout "TO BATTLE!" The other ogres soon shouted "TO BATTLE" as well. Smiling the commander raised his hand to signal the other ogres to be silent before giving a slight nod to me and saying to me "To Battle."

The commander didn't give much more time for the other ogres to get themselves ready; likely mindful of the group coming from behind us. Giving a command for the ogres to gather, he formed them into several small groups. I was told to join the group closest to the sea while the commander assumed his position in one of the middle groups. When the ogres were assembled he gave the order to advance and we quickly began to forge ahead over the landscape. The hazards of the land prevented each group from keeping pace with each other, though each individual group moved in a fairly disciplined manner. I dodged lava, uneven ground, burnt foliage, and the crashing waves of boiling water as I tried to keep up with my group. This would continue until we could see the image of the group of fanatics in front us.]], [[[i]我过去的生命中从来没见过一场战斗，更别说亲自参加了。不过，我不认为食人魔都和我一样。他们说自己以游牧小贩的身份生活，但我不知道这是否只是他们自己身份的一个伪装。也许，他们是一群雇佣兵，或者参加过其他类似的战斗冒险？很难想象他们的过去是什么。[/i]

意识到眼前的情况，刚才一直挽着我胳膊的食人魔现在开始和其他食人魔一起着手准备战斗。他走上前去，向其他人发表了讲话。“敌人现在两路夹击了我们，但我们现在还没有被围困住。我们身后的追兵必须穿过一片我们刚刚穿过的险恶土地，而我们前面的人离我们仍有一段距离。我们有时间制定一个计划，在任何一队追兵到达之前准备战斗。”那位食人魔说完后，另一个指挥官很快吹嘘道，“你要我们做什么，指挥官！”新任的指挥官咕哝着回答：“首先，我们需要一个进攻计划。”

另一个食人魔站了起来，说：“每一队敌人向我们移动的速度有多快，哪一队会先接近我们？”指挥官停顿了一会儿，然后看了看前面和后面两队接近的追兵。在看完后，他回答说：“我们后面的追兵更近，但看起来因为路途过于危险，他们只能缓慢穿越我们刚才通过的地形。另一组敌人正在快速接近。他们可能会先找到我们。战略家，你认为我们应该先攻击前线吗？”我看到这位被称为战略家的食人魔抬起头，在被点名时微微一笑，然后说：“是的，长官！也许我们可以在后面的追兵到来之前，突破前方的敌人？”

指挥官点点头，然后说：“我们没有任何武器，但我们可以利用环境为我们提供优势。把他们撞到危险的地形上面，用地上的障碍来避免被他们的人数压倒。要使用一切卑劣的手段，把这些焦灼的泥土砸到他们脸上。”指挥官停下来喘口气，然后喊道：“我们不会回去的！”对此，其他食人魔也同样喊道：“我们不会再回去了！”然后，所有的食人魔都爆发出一声响亮的吼叫，他们举起双臂高声喊叫，一边互相握手，一边做着奇怪的手势，完全没有了我刚才看到的他们的懦弱表现的迹象。

我立刻注意到那些更大的食人魔朝着几棵枯树猛扑过去，并以惊人的力量轻松把它们从地上拔了起来。在折断树枝和树根之后，它们开始像挥舞巨大的棍棒一样摆动树干。更聪明的食人魔把衣服撕成细细的条子。他们脱掉皮带，把皮带和布条一起做成粗制的投石索。其他的食人魔收集岩石并把它们堆在附近的地面上，作为投石索的弹药。其他的食人魔似乎是一对一对地摆出奇怪的姿势。开始在空中演练拳打脚踢，我认为这是在进行徒手格斗的练习。

我看到这些食人魔以他们惊人的能力迅速变成一支战斗部队，对此深感敬畏。我甚至没注意到指挥官什么时候向我走来。为了引起我的注意，他大声说：“自然精灵，集中注意力！”我的头向他的方向转过去，“什…什么？”我结结巴巴地说着，重新注意到现在紧迫的处境。“你有什么可以帮助我们的东西吗？”我记下了食人魔的话，很快就把背包从肩上拿下来，伸手进去展示里面的东西。“这就是我所有的一切”我说。指挥官向袋子里窥视，然后伸手去拿我在纳格尔王国买回来的斧头和实用刀。

他每只手称了一下这两件东西的重量，然后拿起斧头，开始挥了几下。他带着满意的表情把刀还给我说：“我不能用这个，它太小了，我的手不能有效地使用。你拿着它，用它来自卫”听到这些话，我很快意识到了一件事情：我要亲自参与这场战斗。虽然我过去曾经赶走一些饥饿的动物，但我没有任何实际的战斗经验，也没有对付过真正的敌人。指挥官看到我气馁的脸，就说：“你已经走到这一步，我看得出，你不是和那些狂热者一伙的。如果你需要的话，可以立刻逃跑，你就能得救。他们很可能会放你走，他们想要追的是我们这些食人魔，而不是你。”

这些话刺痛了我，使我很生气。我冲着指挥官喊道：“不，我会和你一起战斗。”我不确定是不是我内心的愤怒让我说出了这些话，但我知道我不会让食人魔独自战斗。我可能会在战斗中死去，但我不会逃避。指挥官和其他食人魔很快朝我的方向瞥了一眼，虽然惊讶，但还是很高兴。一个食人魔欢快地喊了一声“加入战斗！”其他的食人魔很快也叫了“加入战斗”。指挥官微笑着举起手来示意其他食人魔保持沉默，然后向我微微点头并对我说“加入战斗！”

指挥官没有给其他食人魔更多的时间让他们做好准备，很可能因为是注意到了我们后面来的追兵。他命令食人魔聚集起来，把他们分成几个小组。我被告知要加入离海最近的小组，而指挥官在中间的一个小组中就任。在食人魔集合后，他下令触发，我们很快就开始在这片土地上前进。大地上的灾害使每一组人无法完全跟上彼此的步伐，但每一组人的行动都相当有纪律。我躲开熔岩，不平坦的地面，燃烧的树叶，滚烫的波浪，试图跟上我的团队。我们就这样继续前进，直到我们看到面前一群狂热者映入我们的眼帘。]], "_t")

t([[[i]Due to the darkness of the sky and the scorched lands of the battlefield it was hard to see anything, but I still remember the sounds of battle in great detail. The bubbling sounds of the lava and boiling water, the warcries that filled the air, the magical discharges from the ogres runes, the sounds of weapons clashing against each other, and so forth. Of course, none of those sounds compared to the death cries of both the zealots and ogres when their lives ceased to be.[/i]

As we closed in I could make out the image of the individual fanatical warriors in the opposing force arrayed against us. Their battle line consisted of a couple of rows, with fighters in the front and archers in back. Considerably out numbered it looked as if they had the upper hand over us, though I wondered if this was entirely the case. Many weren't wearing masks, and their tattered clothing reminded me of the refugees in the Nargol Kingdom. Perhaps they were new initiates, swayed to join by the words of the masked zealots who stood with them. All the initiates wielded weapons but even I could tell that they had little idea of how to hold them properly.

The masked zealots within the group were a different story. They held their weapons well and a few of them wore armor. The metal gleamed in the darkness as the light from the surrounding lava bounced off the metallic plates, chains, and rivets lining their bodies. Most stood in the front line, even some of those with a bow or sling in hand, likely to encourage their new initiates by leading from the front. Of those with a mask over their face I recognized one as well - the halfling I had encountered in the tent from the Nargol Kingdom. Unlike the others, the halfling still wore that same leather armor from that first meeting of ours. I remembered those swift movements the halfling had made and wondered how much of a difficult and bloody fight this might come to be.

Voices rang out from the zealots as they prepared the initiates around them to defend themselves. Shots and arrows came towards us with lightning speed as we advanced causing a couple ogres to howl as they were hit by the incoming fire. Those ogres with makeshift slings in our ranks soon began to throw rocks into the opposing line. Many of their shots peppered the initiates in the front causing those hit to holler in pain, stagger about dazed and confused, and otherwise bring disorder to the fanatics’ lines. Then I heard a call from our commander, causing us to stop a small distance away from their line. The fanatics look at the ogres with confused faces, and I must say I did so as well, before I noticed several of the ogres raise their arms up.

All at once an array of colors lit up our darkened surroundings as the insignias on their rune covered skin began to glow. As I looked at one of the ogres near me I could see a light green glow encircle her arm and then a torrent of acid appear. The acid lashed out at several of the fanatics, drenching their bodies and causing their exposed skin to visibly burn. Then a flash of lightning shot forward from behind me, piercing through a zealot and one of the initiates behind him. All at once many of the fanatics in front of us began to scatter for cover, unable to cope with the onslaught of power that the ogres were unleashing on them. Many of the initiates fell to the magical barrage while others began to break ranks from the opposing line and flee.

It looked as if we had the fanatics on their back foot but then I heard a piercing cry, the screeching sounded very much like what I had heard from back in the Nargol Kingdom. As I looked around to survey what was happening now, I noticed all at once my surroundings had darkened again. I could see some of the ogres near me try to raise their arms but the light from the insignia's on their skin had now dimmed and failed to work anymore. Ahead of us many of the fanatics lay on the ground injured or dead, though many of them still stood ready to fight. All at once they seem to cheer and beat their swords, apparently not dissuaded by the ogres efforts against them. Out of the corner of my eye though I noticed a figure charge forward.

Running by some lava, I could see that it was our commander, gritting his teeth and my hatchet in his hand as it glistened from the light of the lava. Pulling back his arm he approached one of the masked zealots and gave him a blow that sent him reeling backwards through the air and into a pool of lava. I remember feeling a dark sense of satisfaction as I saw that first zealot burn alive; a fitting end for one who likely took part in the burning's I had witnessed before. The hooting and hollering from the enemy ceased at this, while the commander turned to a shaken initiate nearby to him. With a simple swipe of the hatchet the ogre sliced the initiates head clean from its body, causing it to sail through the air and land on the ground a fair distance away.

The mere sight of the commander in action inspired the other ogres, who immediately charged to join into the carnage. Visibly unnerved now at the wall of giant figures moving against them, many of the remaining initiates began to flee as the ogres approached. Many of the masked zealots stayed to fight but they were soon set upon and clobbered to death by both fists and tree trunks. Those zealots that wore armor would put up more of a fight, though one by one they were being taken out too. The enemy was falling before us and I was sure that the battle was nearly won. That is until I saw an ogre sail through the air above me, landing into the boiling waters of the sea nearby.

One by one other ogres began to join a growing chorus of agonizing cries as something set upon them. Peering out into the shadows I could see a small image rushing all around the battlefield in the direction of their origin. Suddenly as the image came to stop near a lake of lava I realized it was the masked halfling on leather armor. Catching an ogre nearby to the lava unaware, the halfling somehow knocked the ogre over, sending the ogre into the hot pool of burning death. Out of the darkness a couple more ogres appeared and one attempted to clobber the halfling with a violent blow. With a simple crouch the halfling ducked before quickly jabbing at the ogres stomach, and jumping up to land a devastating kick against the ogres head.

The other ogre soon moved to attack the halfling, but with a sidestep the halfling simply moved out of the way before disappearing into the darkness. The ogre followed, but from the grunting and yelling it seemed that the ogre did not fare well either. The halfling would emerge again and again, knocking ogres down with seemingly ease, before escaping from counterattack. Ogres in the darkness would be attacked and shout in pain while those who strayed too close to the hazards of the landscape would soon find themselves sent spiraling into the deathtraps of the land. In an instant the battle had shifted in the fanatics favor, and panic and fear was beginning sweep over the ogres.]], [[[i]由于天空的黑暗和战场的焦土，很难看到任何东西，但我仍然非常详细地记得战斗的声音。熔岩和沸水的冒泡声，空气中充斥的战吼声，食人魔符文的魔法释放声，武器相互碰撞的声音，等等。当然，这些声音都比不上狂热者和食人魔死后的哀嚎声。[/i]

当我们接近的时候，我可以辨认出敌对势力中的狂热战士的形象。他们的战线由两排组成，前面是战士，后面是弓箭手。虽然我不知道这是否完全准确，但他们似乎占了我们的上风。许多人没有戴面具，他们破烂的衣服让我想起纳格尔王国的难民。也许他们是一群新兵，被与他们站在一起的蒙面狂热者的话语所左右。这些新兵都挥舞着武器，但即使是我也能看出，他们根本不知道如何正确地使用武器。

小队里戴着面具的狂热者则是另一回事。他们娴熟地使用着武器，其中一些人穿着盔甲。周围熔岩的光从金属板、铁链和铆钉上反射出来，金属在黑暗中闪闪发光。他们大多数人站在前线，也有有些人手拿弓箭或投石索，准备鼓励他们的新兵冲锋陷阵。在那些脸上戴着面具的人中，我认出了一个熟人——那是我在纳格尔王国帐篷里遇到的半身人。与其他人不同的是，半身人仍然穿着我们第一次见面时的皮甲。我还记得那半身人敏锐的动作，我知道，这会是一场多么艰难和血腥的战斗。

狂热者高声喊叫，指挥周围的新兵做好自卫准备。当我们前进时，子弹和箭矢以闪电般的速度向我们飞来，当两个食人魔被来袭的弓箭击中时，他们嚎叫起来。那些在我们队伍中使用临时投石索的食人魔很快就开始向对方投掷石块。他们的射击射中了前方的新兵们，那些被击中的人发出痛苦的叫喊，在茫然和困惑中摇摇晃晃，给狂热者的队伍里带来了混乱。然后我听到指挥官的一个命令，让我们停在离他们队伍不远的地方。狂热者看着突然停下的食人魔露出了困惑的表情，我必须承认我也陷入了困惑不解之中，直到我注意到几个食人魔举起了自己手臂。

他们的符文覆盖的皮肤上的纹样开始发光，多彩的光芒立刻照亮了我们黑暗的环境。当我看向身边的一只食人魔时，我看到一道浅绿色的光芒环绕着她的手臂，突然间一股酸液喷涌出来。酸液扑向了几个狂热分子，浸透了他们的身体，使他们暴露在外的皮肤严重灼伤。紧接着，一道闪电从我身后射出，穿透了一个狂热者和他身后的一个新兵。一瞬间，我们面前的许多狂热者开始四处寻找掩护，无法应付食人魔向他们释放的力量的冲击。许多新兵被魔法直接击中，而其他人则开始从敌阵中脱离，试图逃跑。

看起来，我们似乎重创了那群狂热分子，但接下来，我听到一声刺耳的叫声，非常像我在纳格尔王国听到的声音。当我环顾四周调查现在发生的事情时，突然发现周围的环境又变暗了。我可以看到，身边的一些食人魔试图举起他们的手臂，但他们皮肤上的纹样发出的光现在已经变暗，无法再工作了。在我们面前，许多狂热分子受伤或死亡，倒在地上，但他们中的许多人仍然准备战斗。他们似乎立刻欢呼并高举剑刃，显然没有被食人魔对他们的攻击所吓倒。在我的余光中，我看到一个人影向前冲去。

在熔岩的光亮映照下，我认出这是我们的指挥官，他咬紧牙关，手里拿着我的斧头，在熔岩的光芒下闪闪发光。他高举手臂，冲向其中一个蒙面的狂热者，给了他一记重击，使他在空中向后翻滚，掉进一滩熔岩中。当我看到第一个狂热者被活活烧死时，我产生了一种黑暗的满足感；这是一个很可能参与我以前亲眼目睹的对别人施以火刑的人恰当的结局。敌人的喊叫声停止了，指挥官转向他身边一个颤抖的新兵。食人魔用斧头轻轻一挥，就把新兵的头从身体上划开，头颅在空中飞行，并在相当远的地方坠落在地上。

指挥官的行动激发了其他食人魔的勇气，他们立即加入了屠杀。在这些巨人的面前，许多其他的新兵们立刻被恐惧压倒了，当食人魔靠近时，他们迅速逃跑。许多蒙面的狂热者留下来战斗，但他们很快就被用拳头和树干殴打致死。那些身穿盔甲的狂热者仍然坚守阵线，但也一个接一个被打倒。敌人在我们面前一个个倒下，我确信这场战斗快要胜利了。直到我看到一位食人魔在我头顶的空中飞过，坠落到附近沸腾的海水中。

食人魔一个接一个地发出痛苦的哀嚎，仿佛有什么东西附着在它们身上。透过阴影，我可以看到一个东西在战场上四处奔腾。当这个东西停在熔岩湖边时，我注意到那是一个戴着皮甲的蒙面半身人。他在熔岩附近抓住一只不慎靠近熔岩的食人魔，不知用什么手段把食人魔打翻了，然后将食人魔扔进了灼热的死亡池。黑暗中又出现了几个食人魔，其中一个试图用猛烈的攻击击打半身人。半身人轻松地蹲下躲开了，迅速地戳向食人魔的腹部，然后跳起来向食人魔的头部踢去毁灭性的一脚。

其他食人魔迅速开始攻击半身人，但是半身人又侧着身子躲开了，然后消失在黑暗中。食人魔紧随其后，但从咕哝和叫喊看来，食人魔的战斗似乎很不顺利。半身人一次又一次地出现，轻松地击倒食人魔，然后逃离反击。黑暗中的食人魔被不断攻击，发出痛苦地叫喊，而那些走得太近的人很快就会发现自己被卷进了这片土地的死亡陷阱。一刹那间，这场战争的天平一下子倒向了狂热分子那边，恐慌和恐惧开始席卷食人魔。]], "_t")

t([[[i]It is hard to describe the sensation that came over me. It was still me, but I didn't feel in control. That other me, it seemed to thrive on the violence I inflicted or received, and wanted nothing more than to endlessly kill. It caused me sadness as I inflicted misery and terror on those in front of me as they died screaming in agony and pain. It is someone I hope to never become again.[/i]

All around me, I could see the ogres near to me beginning to lose any will to fight. What's worse is that some of the initiates that had fled had now returned. They began to batter their shields once more, hollering and posturing as they cheered on the halfling. From one of them I heard the phrase "hooray for nature's champion!" They would yell other phrases as well such as "nature's might shall prevail" or "the ogre's magical taint on Eyal ends!" The sheer display of strength from the halfling and the cries of the initiates further unnerved the ogres, so much so that some began to shake in fear and turn into cowards yet again. In front of me an ogre even dropped her weapons and fell to the ground, having lost all hope.

I could feel tears begin to stream down my eyes. I could feel the anguish and dismay of the ogres, and the hateful emotions being directed at them. I remembered the burning event back in the Nargol Kingdom, and how the zealots instigated those initial actions I had witnessed. It made my angry, angry at those inflicting the pain, inflicting it for their petty reasons. The ogres didn't deserve this nor did the innocent victims that the fanatics burned alive from before. Those inflicting pain, producing these atrocities, they were insufferable gnats, and what's more they disparaged nature's name while doing so. I felt I had to do something to keep this from happening again; I FELT I NEEDED TO KILL THEM.

"Does the little thalore wish to leave?" I heard a voice say to me. "Maybe run back to that little forest of yours?" I looked up to see a masked dwarf, holding an axe and shield. "We know of ya Fay Willows. Ya have no taint of magic, yet are ya an ally of nature? From where ya stand it would seem that ya are an ally of da ogres." The dwarf brandished the weapon wildly as it continued to talk, "Ya know, perhaps I shouldn't be blamin' ya. I'm sure da ogres told ya some wild tales, and this is just a misunderstandin'. We just want to help da ogres ya know, and they seem to be getting a little bit more cooperative now. It is a shame a few of them had to die, but a message had to be sent." The dwarf seemingly began to chuckle for a moment as it finished speaking.

The dwarf stopped chuckling to continue, "How about ya cooperate with us as well elf-ie? Else I'm afraid I'm going to have to hu-[b]RRRRRRRK![/b]"

All at once the sounds of battle seemed to disappear as I focused solely on the dwarf in front of me. Looking forward all I could see was blood. Blood on my hand, on my arm, on the dagger that lay plunged in the throat of the dwarf, on the mask the dwarf wore, and from under the mask as the dwarf coughed up blood. Dropping the axe and shield to grasp at the dagger, the dwarf choked as it tried to breathe. Slowly I bent down to pick up the axe and with both hands I brought it back behind my head. Then with all my strength I brought the axe down on the head of the dwarf with all my might. I felt a strange feeling within me as the dwarf died to the blow, coursing through every fiber of my being.

At that moment I recalled the Eldoral halfling I had killed from before when I initially first traveled from my home. I had hated the reasons said in support of the Spellblaze, and I became angered to no end of the one spouting that nonsense. I had followed the halfling out with a steak knife that I had taken from a nearby table and... I killed him. It was a horrible feeling taking a life, yet a dark surge of energy coursed through me, wanting to drive me to kill more. This drive to kill, it was the real reason I had fled that settlement. I was afraid I would kill someone, someone who didn't deserve it. That halfling I killed didn't deserve to die. But, these zealots, didn't they deserve it?

At that point something snapped in my mind I think. I remember laughing very loudly. It was dreadful feeling. I might have been crying too. I couldn't tell what was happening with me or my emotions and I wondered if I was going mad; and I still wonder this even now to be honest. But that wasn't important. The ogres around me could no longer fight, and I knew that if nothing was done that they would die, or worse. There was no innocence to be found from these zealots, these instigators of torment and madness, or the initiates blindly following them. I could simply kill them all with a clear conscious, and hopefully satisfy the urges within me to kill. All would be well with me after that, and perhaps the ogres would even thank me for saving them.

Then I noticed a masked human zealot looking at me and the corpse of the dwarf on the ground. I began to walk over, the human seemingly waving a sword in one hand in a threatening manner. For some reason I thought it was kind of funny, despite what should have caused me to think of an intense fear for own well being. I could hear muffled shouts of something coming from the human, though I couldn't distinguish what was being said. As I drew closer I saw the human shake, so much so that the mask shifted enough that I could partially see the face of the man underneath. I could see the fear in his eye before the human raised his shield in an attempt to hide away. I remember the enjoyment I felt of that fear.

I used my axe to sweep the shield from the humans hands, knocking it away so he couldn't hide his eyes away from mine anymore, allowing me to relish in his terror. I think I was smiling at this point, grinning madly as the fear built up in the human. At the same time though the sadness inside me, it too was building more and more, threatening to plunge me into the depths of darkness. The human was terrified, and attempted to thrust forward to attack me, crying out something as he lunged towards... Where was he attacking actually? I think he had intended to attack me, but he ended up moving over to the side. I simply raised the axe in my hand, and as I had done before brought it down, connecting a deep blow on his shoulder.

The human’s swordarm fell away from his body, causing him to cry out before dropping to the ground to hold where his arm use to be. The red blood spurted and bubbled from his severed arm as the sword still lay clutched in the closed hand. The human tried to crawl away, and then I noticed the lovely pool of lava nearby. I smiled a little as I kicked at his body sending him spiraling in. I felt a strange sense of joy as he burned alive in front of me, yet simultaneously felt disdain for what I had just done. I felt another surge of energy coarse through me as the man finally died, and I felt a greater urge to kill even more. I wondered at this point if I could stop myself or if I could be stopped?

I could hear the screams of terror of others around me and noticed that the sounds weren't coming from those wearing masks either - easy pickings to satisfy my urge to kill. I began to approach them as they yelled at me, my intense hatred building with each step. Suddenly though I felt a strong pull on my arm, preventing me from moving forward. Looking to see what I had got caught on, I noticed the masked halfling, clutching my arm. Hatred surged within me and all I could think about was how I should pay this halfling back for what had been done to me in that tent from before. I forgot about the others weaklings, focusing all my attention towards my new prey.]], [[[i]我很难形容那种感觉。我仍然是我，但我感觉无法控制自己。另一个我，似乎是在我所施加或接受的暴力中茁壮成长，她只想进行没完没了的杀戮。她让我感到悲伤，因为我给其他的人带来了痛苦和恐惧，他们在绝望和痛苦中尖叫着死去。这是我希望永远不再成为的人。[/i]

在我周围，我可以看到我身边的食人魔开始失去战意。更糟糕的是，一些逃走的新兵现在已经回来了。他们开始再次击打盾牌，一边喊着一边摆出姿势为半身人欢呼。我从其中一个人那里听到一句话：“大自然的战士万岁！”他们还会喊出其他的短语，比如“自然的力量终将胜利！”或者“食人魔这一马基埃亚尔的污点，终将被消灭！”半身人的力量和新兵们的呼喊使食人魔更加不安，以至于有些人开始害怕地颤抖，再次变得懦弱起来。在我面前，一个食人魔甚至丢下武器，倒在地上，失去了一切希望。

我能感觉到眼泪开始顺着我的眼睛流下来。我能感觉到食人魔的痛苦和沮丧，以及他们身上的仇恨情绪。我还记得在纳格尔王国发生的火刑事件，以及狂热者如何煽动我所目睹的第一次猎魔行动。这让我充满愤怒，对那些造成痛苦的人，以及对它们拙劣的借口充满愤怒。食人魔不应该受到这样的对待，被那些狂热分子活活烧死的无辜受害者也是这样。那些人用痛苦给其他人带来折磨，制造了这些暴行，它们是令人无法忍受的害虫，更何况，它们在这样做的时候诋毁了大自然的名字。我觉得我必须做些什么来阻止这种事情再次发生：我觉得我需要杀死他们。

“小自然精灵，想逃跑吗？”我听到一个声音对我说。“你想要回你的小树林里去，对吧？”我抬头看到一个蒙面矮人，手里拿着斧头和盾牌。“我们知道你，菲·维莉欧斯。你的身上没有魔法力量的印记，但你真的是大自然的盟友吗？从你的立场看，你似乎是一个大食人魔的盟友。”矮人挥舞着武器狂野地继续说，“你知道，也许我不该责怪你。我敢肯定大食人魔给你讲了一些荒诞的故事，这只是个误会。我们只是想帮助你认识的食人魔，现在，他们就会变得更加愿意和我们合作了。他们中有几个人不得不死去，这真是太可惜了，但我们必须向他们发出一个信息。”矮人说完话，开始咯咯地笑了起来。

矮人停止了笑声，继续说：“你还是和我们合作吧，怎么样，小——精灵？如果不愿意的话，我恐怕得伤[b]啊啊啊啊啊！[/b]”

当我全神贯注于眼前的矮人时，战斗的声音立刻消失了。向前看，我只能看到一片鲜血。鲜血从我手上，胳膊上，插在矮人喉咙里的匕首上，矮人戴的面具上，还有矮人咳血时从面具下滴落。矮人放下斧头和盾牌试图抓住匕首，想要呼吸，但却哽咽了。我慢慢弯腰捡起斧头，双手把斧头高举过头顶。然后，我用尽全力把斧头砍在矮人的头上。我感到一种奇怪的感觉萦绕着我的内心，矮人亲手被我杀死了，他的哀嚎穿过我的全身。

在那一刻，我想起了我第一次从家里旅行时杀死的艾德瑞尔半身人。我讨厌他那些支持魔法大爆炸的理由，那些胡说八道的话让我怒不可遏。我从旁边的桌子上拿了一把牛排刀，跟着半身人走了出来……我杀了他。夺去生命是一种可怕的感觉，然而一股黑暗的能量涌向我，想驱使我去杀更多的人。这是我逃离定居点的真正原因。我怕我会杀了一个人，一个不配死的人。我杀的那个半身人不配死。但是，这些狂热者，难道他们就应该死吗？

在那一刻，我突然想到了一些事情。我记得我笑得很大声。那是一种可怕的感觉。我可能也哭了。我不知道发生了什么，也不知道我的感情是什么样，我不知道我是不是疯了，老实说，我现在仍然不知道。但那并不重要。我周围的食人魔已经无法再战斗了，我知道如果什么都不做，他们就会死，或者更糟。从这些狂热者，这些折磨和疯狂的煽动者，或是盲目追随他们的新兵，他们的双手都沾满了鲜血。我可以意识清醒地简单地杀死他们，希望能满足我内心的杀戮欲望。从那以后，一切都会好起来的，也许食人魔会感谢我救了他们。

然后我注意到一个戴着面具的人类狂热者，正看着我和地上矮人的尸体。我开始走过去，那个人似乎在用一种威胁的方式挥舞着一把剑。出于某种原因，我觉得这有点好笑，尽管这让我产生了对自己幸福的强烈恐惧。我能听到那个人类的低沉的声音，尽管我不能分辨出他们在说什么。当我走近时，我看到了人类在恐惧中颤栗，他的面具部分因颤抖落下，我可以部分地看到下面那个人的脸。在人类举起盾牌试图躲开之前，我可以看到他眼中的恐惧。我记得那种恐惧给我带来的快乐。

我用我的斧头把盾牌从人类手中扫开，敲落在地。他在我的目光中已经无处躲藏，这样我就可以享受他的恐惧了。我想，那时的我正在大笑着，疯狂地笑着，看着恐惧压倒那个人类的心头。同时，我内心的悲伤也在越来越多地堆积起来，威胁着我陷入黑暗的深处。那人吓坏了，想冲上前去攻击我，他冲过来时大叫了一声……他到底在攻击哪个方向？我想他是想攻击我，但他最后扑了个空。我轻松举起手中的斧头，像以前一样使出挥砍，对着他肩膀上来了一记重击。

这个人的持剑的手从他身上断裂下来，他哭了出来，倒在地上他胳膊的地方。他的剑仍然紧握在断裂的手上，血从他断臂的伤口中喷涌而出。人类试图爬走，然后我注意到附近可爱的熔岩池。我笑了笑，一脚踢向他的身体，他的身躯盘旋着跌入了岩浆之中。他在我面前活生生地燃烧着，我感到一种奇怪的喜悦，但同时也对我刚才所做的感到不屑。当那个人最终死去时，我感觉到另一股能量涌向我，让我更强烈地想杀人。我在想，已经到这一步了，我还可以阻止自己，或者说，还有人能阻止我吗？

我能听到周围其他人恐惧的尖叫声，注意到这些声音也不是来自那些戴着面具的人——这些弱者是满足我杀人的欲望的合适目标。听着他们绝望的喊叫声，我开始接近他们，强烈的仇恨灌注着我的脚步。突然间，我感觉到手臂上有一股强大的拉力，阻止了我向前移动。我想看看是什么东西抓住了我，发现是那个戴着面具的半身人抓着我的胳膊。仇恨涌上心头，我所能想到的就是我该如何偿还这个半身人从前在帐篷里对我所做的一切。我忘记了其他弱者，把所有的注意力都集中在我的新猎物上。]], "_t")

t([[[i]I'm not sure how big the fanatics’ group was when we battled them, though out of them only about twenty or so wore masks. What I do know is that when I first saw the ogres that they numbered over fifty. After the battle there was only nine of them with me when we made our escape. This isn't to say that all the other ogres were killed though and I wonder what cruel end they met at the hands of those fanatics we had left them in.[/i]

Unlike the other zealots, I could remember some of the words that came from the halfling on that battlefield. 'I should have killed you', 'a mistake to spare me', and so forth. All of a sudden though the halfling stopped talking as I felt something deep within me come out, and overwhelming hatred that I seemed to channel into the halfling's body. While this happened, I took my other arm and raised the axe high, bringing down its backside on the halflings shoulder in an effort to escape his grip. I could feel the power of the blow as it connected, the force of the impact reverberating through both of our bodies. I could hear the halfling clench its teeth, feeling the pain from the blow, before I was quickly thrown to the ground.

Almost immediately I got up, with feelings full of violence that I was ready to unleash. I don't know what happened next but I immediately remember striking the halflings back, somehow seemingly moving around in an instant. A howl of pain erupted from the halfling as the blow connected. The halfling attempted to jab at me furiously in response, but I simply used my free hand to knock away the meager blows, before beginning to make an all out assault. Blow after blow struck my prey, leaving deep gashes in the halflings armor. At this point I could remember the grin on my face tearing at my face muscles in an unnatural way and the hatred within me unleashing with every blow.

The halfling not amused by my attacks attempted to strike back with a series of kicks. I remember receiving several hits to my body though feeling little from them. I immediately swiped back at the halfling, though the blow was easily dodged, before a fury of punches were released against me. Annoyed now I retaliated wildly with a slash of the axe, relishing the scream unleashed into the air by the halfling as my attack connected, cutting deep through the leather armor into the flesh underneath. At this point the halfling began to cough up blood, suffering greatly from the inflicted wound. I could feel my hatred burning within the halfling now, tearing at the insides from the wound I had just inflicted. It was an intoxicating feeling.

My emotions completely enveloped me at that point as I began to swing by axe relentlessly with little care of what I hit. The halfling tried to dodge my blows but a number of them hit home. Blood flew as I sliced at the halfling, and possibly some other fanatics that unfortunately happened into my path. Finally having enough of this the halfling made a swift move in the other direction, to get away from me, attempting to escape the retribution that I was bringing forth. The halfling dropped close to the ground, the injuries I had rendered now taking their toll. I could hear murmuring around me too, noticing all the fanatics, both initiates and zealots, backing away.

Thinking about what I should do next, I felt a large hand on my shoulder, turning me about so I could see the face of the ogre strategist. Talking quickly, the strategist relayed to me in a winded voice, "We can't linger here anymore, the other zealots behind us are closing in, we need to push through and get out of here." Looking behind me, I could see the figures approaching rapidly, a far larger group and likely much better armed and armored, as the light flickered off the wall of metal coming for us. However, looking ahead I saw only a handful of initiates and zealots left, and knew that if we broke through them then at least those ogres still fighting could get to safety.

I called out to the ogres to breakthrough now, before charging towards the terrified fanatics ahead of me. The remaining ogres who were still fighting saw this and began to rally, then move forward towards the freedom we sought. There was no resistance left to be found in the fanatics, their morale was completely broken. Some who couldn't scramble out of our way were trampled as we ran over them. Looking back at the battlefield I caught a glimpse of the halfling, who stared at me with a cold hatred, but at the same time could not do anymore. I could feel a bit of satisfaction rise within me, from snubbing the zealots, and for helping to at least get those ogres now with me away.

Many of the ogres had fallen during the battle, many killed by that halfling's hands. Some ogres remained on the battlefield, alive but too injured to follow; or too demoralized in the case of some, like that female ogre I had witnessed collapsed to the ground, left to the whims of those zealots. There was no way for us to retrieve them, the other group of zealots had already caught up and had begun their pursuit of us, and wouldn't stop chasing us for a long time. Even after they disappeared from view we continued to run for a long while. When we did stop it was only after one of the ogres had fallen down due to wounds inflicted in the recent battle.

Making my way over to the ogre I was quick to treat her wounds. The ogre commander had managed to survive the battle, though he also had injuries visible all over his body, and quickly came over to also be treated. The ogre strategist was quick to take charge at that point in the journey, telling me to only use the infusions enough to close their wounds so that we could get moving again. Eventually later on when we stopped again to gather our breath I would continue my treatment with my remaining infusions as best I could. After that we would run a distance, stop to rest, and run again several times. It felt as if we didn't stop running until after the sun became visible in the sky once more.]], [[[i]我不知道当我们与他们战斗时，狂热分子的队伍有多大。尽管据我所知，他们中只有大约二十人戴着面具。当我第一次看到那些食人魔的时候，他们有超过五十人。而当战斗结束后，我们逃跑时，只有九个人和我在一起。但这并不是说所有其他的食人魔都被杀了，我不知道那些幸存者在那些狂热分子手中遇到了什么残酷的结局。[/i]

与其他狂热者不同的是，我记得战场上半身人说的一些话，“我应该杀了你”，“原谅你是我的错误”，等等。突然之间，我感觉到自己内心深处有什么东西出来了，半身人停止了说话，我似乎把压倒性的仇恨灌注进了半身人的身体。当这一切发生的时候，我举起我的另一只胳膊，把斧头举得很高，用斧头的背面重击半身人的肩膀，试图逃脱他的控制。我能感觉到撞击的力量，那股力量我们两个身体中回荡。我能听到半身人咬紧牙关，感觉到被打的疼痛，然后我很快就被扔到了地上。

我几乎立刻站起来，准备随时释放我的暴力。我不知道接下来发生了什么，但我立刻反击了半身人，不是怎么做到的，似乎在一瞬间就完成了移动。当那一击接连而来时，半身人发出一阵痛苦的嚎叫。半身人试图猛烈地攻击我，但我只是用我的另一只手击退了微弱的打击，然后开始全力以赴的攻击。一次又一次的打击击中了我的猎物，在半身人的盔甲上留下了深深的伤口。这时，我记得我脸上的笑容以一种不自然的方式撕裂了我的面部肌肉，每一次打击都会释放出我内心的仇恨。

半身人在我一连串的进攻面前，试图用一系列的踢腿反击。我记得我的身体受到了几次打击，但我几乎没有感觉到痛苦。我立即回击了半身人，但这一击被轻易躲开，一记猛烈的拳击打到我的身上。我的心中充满怒火，疯狂地用斧头砍了一刀，享受着半身人向空中发出的尖叫声，因为我的连击将皮甲深深地刺穿了，刺入下面的肉。半身人身受重伤，开始咳血。我能感觉到我的仇恨在半身人的身体里燃烧，从我刚刚造成的伤口里撕裂他的内脏。这是一种令人陶醉的感觉。

在我开始毫不留情地挥舞斧头时，我的情绪完全了笼罩着我。那个半身人试图躲开我的打击，但有相当数量的攻击命中了目标。当我切开半身人的身躯，鲜血飞扬，可能还有其他一些狂热分子不幸地因为被卷入而被我的斧头击中。半身人终于受够了这一切，迅速地向另一个方向移动，想逃离我，试图逃避我带来的复仇。结果，他倒在了地上，我造成的伤害对他造成了严重的创伤。我也能听到周围的低语，注意到所有狂热分子，包括新兵和狂热者，都退后了。

当我正在想接下来该怎么办的时候，我感觉到有一只大手搭在我的肩膀上，我转过身来，看到了食人魔战略家的脸。战略家语速飞快地对我说：“我们不能再在这里逗留了，我们后面的其他狂热分子正在逼近，我们需要迅速离开这里。”看向身后，我可以看到人影迅速逼近，那是一个更大的队伍，很可能武装和装甲更精良，他们身上的装甲反射着金属的光泽。然而，环视四周，我只看到少数的新兵和狂热者，我知道，如果我们突破他们，那么至少那些仍在战斗的食人魔可以安全逃离。

我现在向食人魔高喊突破的命令，然后冲向前面吓坏了的狂热者。其余仍在战斗的食人魔看到了这一点，开始集结，朝着我们寻求的自由前进。那些狂热分子毫无抵抗能力，他们的士气完全崩溃了。当我们从他们身上碾过时，许多人都无法没能逃脱。回首战场，我瞥见了那个半身人，他凝视着我的眼神带着冰冷的仇恨，但同时也无能为力。我能感觉到一点满足感在我内心升起，那是碾碎那些狂热者，并帮助至少这些食人魔安全离开的喜悦。

许多食人魔在战斗中倒下，其中大部分死在那个半身人的手中。有些食人魔仍然留在战场上，活着，但受了重伤，无法跟上；有些人则士气低落，就像我亲眼看到的那个女食人魔倒在地上，被那些狂热者所蹂躏。我们没有办法救回他们，另一伙狂热者已经追上了我们，开始了他们对我们的追击，并在很长一段时间内不停地追着我们。即使他们不见了，我们也继续跑了很长一段时间。直到又有一只食人魔在最近的战斗中受伤倒下后，我们才停了下来。

我走到食人魔跟前，很快就治好了她的伤口。食人魔指挥官在战斗中幸存了下来，尽管他身上到处都是可见的伤痕，他很快也过来接受治疗。食人魔战略家很快就从那一刻开始，接管了旅程中的一切，告诉我只能用足够的纹身来封闭伤口，这样我们才能再次行动。最后，当我们再次停下来喘口气时，我尽我所能用剩下的纹身继续治疗。然后我们跑了一段距离，停下来休息，再跑了几次。直到太阳再次出现在天空中，我们才停止奔跑。]], "_t")

t([[[i]The endurance of an ogre is quite astonishing. While I had collapsed from exhaustion, the ogres had persevered and managed to stay awake until we made it to an abandoned settlement. In particular, while many of the ogres had managed to acquire some sleep along with me, the commander and strategist would manage to make the entire journey to Elvala before they would finally collapse from exhaustion. I honestly don't believe any other race could possibly stay awake, let alone active, for that long.[/i]

I don't know how long I had spent within that hellish shoreline; perhaps days or even a week. It was good to see some semblance of greenery and living nature again as we proceeded to head into the area just south of the Nargol lands. I basked a little in the natural sunlight from the sky, before feeling the rumbling in my stomach, and the heavy weight of exhaustion from so much running. The ogres for their part did not seem the least bit tired or hungry, but after such a long travel I wondered if this was truly the case. Reaching for my pack I pulled out my provisions and laid them on the ground. Almost immediately I noticed the hungry stares from the ogres.

Have you ever seen a hungry ogre? Within an instant they will eat any food in front of them. I barely had time to get out of the way before the entire group of them converged on the tasty morsels that had come into their view. When I looked back next, I noticed that all the provisions I had laid out were gone, and the ogres were now rummaging through my backpack to see if they could find more. After failing to find any they adopted some semblance of civility once more. The commander got up and came over to thank me for the food and asked that I excuse himself and the others for their over eagerness. That didn't do anything for my own hunger but I'm glad they enjoyed filling their stomachs I guess.

From behind the strategist approached and clutched in his hand was one of the rations of food from my bag. Noticing it I quickly snatched at that food when he offered it and hungrily devoured it. Half of it had already been eaten, but considering how hungry I was I didn't really care. Both the commander and strategist seemed to chuckle at this. As they regained their composure though I could see the reality of the situation creep back into their faces. Once again I could see the dark blue glow appear over the eyes of commanders face as he looked in the direction of the southern shoreline. "Any sign of them?” the strategist asked. "No, but that doesn't mean we are in the clear,” the commander responded.

I don't remember much after that. I do recall that the commander and strategist talked to each other for a bit, but apparently during their conversation I passed out. When I woke up I was next to a campfire on a couple mattresses sandwiched between a couple of the ogres. Above the fire a skewered wolf was slowly being turned, and seeing me wake up, the ogre turning the spit called out that I was awake. Looking around I noticed several ogres soundly sleeping on various makeshift beds and chairs ranging from batches of grass on the ground and tables propped next to walls. I could tell that we were now in one of the abandoned Shaloren settlements, which made we wonder as to just how long I was out and what had happened since.

The commander and strategist then approached from behind one of the buildings. The strategist called out, "How are you doing thalore? Did you rest well?" I was a bit groggy from waking up but I replied back, "I'll rest better when we get to Elvala. What has happened?" To this I received a quick story, noting that we had arrived at the outskirts of Shaloren territory and that the ogres had carried me here after I had collapsed. Periodically from behind I could see the commander looking out in various directions with his vision rune, still on the lookout for any trouble. The strategist noted that what appeared to be scouts for the zealots had been following us, but hanging back far in the distance.

"We can't linger here much longer.” the strategist commented. Looking at the strategist I asked, "When will we be heading out next?" Before the strategist even had a chance to reply the commander boomed from behind him, "Immediately after you have had something to eat." I could tell from the commanders facial expressions that he was suggesting the meat cooking above the fireplace. I was a bit disgusted by the thought of this so I noted that I would go acquire my own food. The commander looked at me when I said this, pausing for a moment, but with a sigh he told me "be quick" before turning away and proceeding to rouse the sleeping ogres from their slumbering.

After a little while of searching through the nearby buildings I noticed a trapdoor with a rusty lock. Breaking it and descending a ladder I found a cellar, untouched since the time the original shaloren inhabitants had lived here. I found several bottles of wine as well as some old vegetables and dried fruit. I brushed away some cobwebs from a nearby chair and table to eat my fill, before carrying a bundle of vegetables and fruit back to the ogres campsite. The commander was already assembling the other ogres, and I could see that a couple of recently killed carcasses slung on their shoulders. Seeing me carrying food, the commander and strategist came over to help take the load and ask where I had found it.

I relayed to them the location of the cellar which I had found and its contents. The commander, while interested in acquiring food, was quite disinterested in the fact that it was located in a shaloren cellar. Concerned with the time it would take to bring it up, he noted that an ogre wouldn't be able to easily fit through any of the doors in the settlement here, let alone a trap door to one of the cellars. The strategist though noted that I had fit through and insisted that we take the food to ensure that there was enough to eat for the remainder of our journey. The commander was hesitant at staying any longer but consented. After spending another hour I was able to bring up all the food before we continued on towards Elvala.   ]], [[[i]食人魔的忍耐力是相当惊人的。当我筋疲力尽的时候，那些食人魔们仍然坚持着，设法保持清醒，直到我们到达一个废弃的定居点。尤其是当许多食人魔和我一起设法获得了一些睡眠时，指挥官和战略家在前往埃尔瓦拉的路程中一直保持清醒，直到到达目的地才最终因精疲力竭而崩溃。我真的不相信其他种族能保持清醒那么长时间，更不用说保持活跃的思维了。[/i]

我不知道我在那可怕的海岸线上呆了多久，也许几天，甚至一个星期。当我们继续前往纳格尔土地以南的地区时，我很高兴再次看到一些绿色植物和活生生的自然景观。我在天空的自然阳光下晒了一会儿，才感觉到肚子里的隆隆声，以及跑了那么久的疲惫感。食人魔表面看起来一点也不累也不饿，但经过了这么长时间的旅行，我觉得这恐怕不是真的。我伸手去拿背包，拿出食物放在地上，几乎立刻就注意到食人魔们饥饿的目光。

你见过饥饿的食人魔吗？他们会在一瞬间吃掉面前的任何食物。我几乎没来得及让开，他们就聚拢在一起吃那些他们看来如此美味的食物。当我下一次回头看的时候，我注意到我已经准备好的东西都不见了，食人魔们正在我的背包里翻来翻去，看能不能找到更多。在找不到任何东西之后，他们又一次露出一副彬彬有礼的样子。司令官起身来感谢我的食物，请我原谅他自己和其他人的过分急切。这对我自己的饥饿没有任何帮助，但我很高兴他们满足地填饱肚子的样子。

战略家从后面走过来，手里拿着我包里的一份口粮，想要拿给我吃。我立刻就把它抢走，狼吞虎咽地吃了下去。这份食物已经被咬了一半，但考虑到我有多饿，我真的不在乎。司令官和战略家似乎都在笑。当他们恢复平静的时候，尽管我可以看到，对真实情况的严峻的担忧，又悄悄地出现在他们的脸上。我又一次看到，当指挥官朝南部海岸线方向看去时，脸上出现了深蓝色的光芒。“有他们的迹象吗？”战略家问道。“不，但这并不意味着我们是安全的，”指挥官回答。

之后的事情我就不记得了。我记得司令官和战略家曾交谈过一段时间，但很明显，在他们的谈话中，我睡着了。当我醒来的时候，我就在篝火旁的一堆床垫上和几个食人魔睡在一起。在火的上方正用杆子插着烤着一只狼，看到我醒了，吐着口水的食人魔告诉别人我醒了。环顾四周，我注意到几只食人魔正酣睡在各种临时床上和椅子上，从地上成堆的草到靠墙支撑的桌子，应有尽有。我发现，我们现在在一个废弃的永恒精灵定居点，我不知道在我睡着的过程中，他们在外面呆了多久，后来发生了什么。

指挥官和战略家随后从其中一座建筑后面靠近。战略家喊道：“你怎么样，自然精灵？你休息得好吗？”我醒来时有点昏昏欲睡，但我回答说：“等我们到了埃尔瓦拉，我会好好休息的。发生了什么事？”对此，我收到了一个简短的消息，说我们到达了永恒精灵领地的郊区，在我倒下后，食人魔把我带到了这里。我不时地从后面看到指挥官拿着他的视野符文朝各个方向望去，仍然在寻找任何追兵。这位战略家注意到，似乎有狂热者的侦察兵一直在跟踪我们，但一直在远处徘徊。

“我们不能在这里逗留下去了。”战略家评论道。看着战略家，我问道：“我们下一步什么时候出发？”战略家还没来得及回答，司令官就从他身后发出沉闷的声音：“等你吃了点东西之后。”我从司令官的面部表情可以看出，他是在暗示在篝火上挂着的烧肉。我对这个想法有点反感，所以告诉他们我会自己去找食物。说完这句话后，司令官看了我一眼，停顿了一会儿，但他叹了口气，告诉我“快点”，然后转身离开，继续把熟睡的食人魔从睡梦中唤醒。

在附近的建筑物里搜寻了一会儿后，我注意到一个锁生锈了的活板门。我打破了它，从梯子上下来，发现了一个地窖，冲有永恒精灵居民在这里居住的时候，开始就一直没有人动过。我发现了几瓶酒，还有一些老蔬菜和干果。我从旁边的椅子和桌子上擦去一些蜘蛛网，吃掉了它们，然后把一捆蔬菜和水果带回食人魔营地。指挥官已经在集合其他的食人魔了，我可以看到一些最近被杀死的动物尸体挂在他们的肩膀上。司令官和战略家看见我提着食物，就过来帮忙拿东西，问我在哪里找到的。

我把找到的地窖的位置和里面的东西转告他们。指挥官虽然对获得食物感兴趣，但对它位于永恒精灵地窖一事却相当不感兴趣。考虑到要花多长时间才能把它提出来，他注意到，一个食人魔没法轻易地穿过这里的任何一扇门，更不用说一个地窖的活板门了。不过，这位战略家注意到我能够通过那扇门，坚持要我们带上食物，以确保剩下的旅程有足够的食物吃。司令官迟疑不肯再留下来，但最终还是同意了。又过了一个小时，我把所有的食物都端上来，然后我们继续朝埃尔瓦拉走去。]], "_t")

t([[[i]I want to emphasize that I come from a society where there is little if any practiced magic, let alone any products of it such as runes. While there were thalore who could use magic, their knowledge was self-taught and done in secret; not to mention that thaloren users of magic were generally ostracized from the rest of the community, if not exiled from Thaloren lands. Even now I still don't know much about the inner workings of the Rune of Return that is grafted to me, though I am working to learn the basics of runes and the greater subject of the arcane forces behind them.[/i]

We continued deeper into Shaloren territory, the fanatics’ scouts continuing to follow us but always careful to stay back and never stray too close. It would be a couple more days before we reached the edge of the Shroud. Navigating to where I had first crossed through the misty wall to get into the city, I reached into my pack to retrieve the Rune of Return that I had received so long ago. With an outstretched hand I presented it to the ogre commander. I had expected him to take it but he simply nodded his head and noted, "A Rune of Return." For the next brief moment I stood there with my hand held out, the commander seemingly as puzzled as I was to our interaction. It wasn't clear until the strategist finally chimed in, "You have no clue how that rune you're holding works do you?"

At this the commander blinked before realizing the situation and noting, "Right, you’re a complete novice." I could feel the blank expression worn on my face and the ogres were seemingly aware of this. "Come over here thalore," a voice called out. I turned my head to see who was calling me, before noting it was a female ogre that I had helped from before, "let's see that rune you got." I was a bit confused, but I made my way over and presented the rune. Taking it in one hand, she proceeded to examine the rune, before handing it back to me. “Right," the ogre began, "this here rune is bonded to you, so only you can inscribe it. After that is done you can use the rune to enter Elvala and request entry for us."

It felt like the words popping out of the ogres mouth were some type of different language. The ogre who I would eventually come to know as my instructor gave a series of explanations about runes, though eventually decided it would just be better to graft the Rune of Return on me instead of giving me a lesson on rune theory. To ensure that I would have the least trouble activating the rune, the ogre chose to graft it on my back just below my neck. I can remember how painful the experience was as the nerves in the back of my spine were pricked and prodded at. Despite the pain though, I can also remember the exhilaration my body felt as it was touched by arcane forces for the first time.

"There then, finished." Pleased with her work, the ogre circled around me to put her hands on my shoulders. "Now, all that is left for you to do is for you to get pass this barrier and make the request for our entry. Thalore, before I tell you what to do to activate the rune, know that I thank you for helping to bring us this far. If it hadn't been for you, I- we ogres... we likely would have all died." I could see the tears beginning to stream down the face of the ogre as she continued "Once again it seems our lives are in your hands. I hope that you will be able to convince the Shaloren to let us in, but even if you can't I wanted to thank you, we all want to thank you." Around me I could see the other ogres bowing their heads.

With a smile I replied back "I'm sure you will be let in. Tell me what it is I need to do." Raising her head while wiping away the tears from her face, I was walked through the process to activate the rune. I gave a solemn nod to the ogres before performing the steps myself. Within an instant my surroundings completely changed as I could hear the bustling of shaloren all around me. I could feel a heavy sensation on my neck where the rune had been inscribed, but other than that I felt no different. A few of the shalore turned to look in my direction, seemingly surprised at my entry, though not as much as I would have expected. One of the shalore soon called out, "You're that thalore who helped us from before? Welcome back!"

"Oh, a, thank you" I replied back, slowly adjusting to the fact that I had abruptly entered Elvala. Quickly, I realized that the ogres were still outside of Elvala waiting for me. Excusing myself, I proceeded to run to the middle of the town where I had previously met the general. As before there stood guards outside the building, though they recognized me as I approached. Panting and out of breath I took a brief moment to inhale and exhale before gasping out "Ogres... seeking asylum... here in... Elvala." The guards in front of me stood in bewilderment after hearing the sentence I let out, seemingly grasping what I had said but unable to determine what to do.

Then from behind me came a voice, "What is this about ogres?" I turned around to see a young female shalore, who I recognized as being one of the mages who saw me off from Elvala. Seeing me, she seemed to oddly cool a bit and address me saying "Ooo, you're that thalore. We've never personally met but I helped teleport you out of Elvala a short while ago. Welcome back to Elvala." Catching my breathe I explained the situation involving the ogres outside, the zealots chasing them, and how they were looking to seek refuge in Elvala. As I finished talking the young shalore stated, "Judging from what you have told me, it would likely be best if those ogres were brought in quickly."

Approaching the guards to communicate something, their bewildered faces quickly became somewhat distressed both by the actions and words of the shalore woman. I don't know what the mage had said, but it seemed as if the guards were almost pleading with the young shaloren woman about something. Eventually she called for me to follow her and began to move in the direction I had come when I entered the city with the Rune of Return. I could tell that this shalore seemed to have some plan in mind, perhaps one that would allow the ogres passage into the city. Before turning to follow her, I noticed the two guards murmer something to each other before one of them rushed inside the building. The other seemed to look at worriedly in the direction of me and the mage as we walked away.]], [[[i]我想强调的是，我来自一个几乎没有任何魔法实践的社会，更不用说像符文这样的魔法产品了。虽然有自然精灵可以使用魔法，但他们的知识是自学的，秘密地做；更不用说，使用魔法的自然精灵通常被排斥在社区的其他人所排斥，乃至赶出自然精灵领土。即使是现在，我仍然不太了解移植到我身上的返回符文的内部运作，尽管我正在努力学习符文的基本知识和背后的奥术力量的更大主题。[/i]

我们继续深入到永恒精灵的领土，狂热分子的侦察兵继续跟踪我们，但总是小心翼翼地保持距离，决不走得太近。再过几天我们才能到达埃尔瓦拉帷幕的边缘，在移动到我第一次穿过迷雾之墙进入城市的地方之后，我把手伸进背包，找回了很久以前收到的返回符文。我伸出一只手把它交给了食人魔指挥官。我本以为他会接受的，但他只是点了点头，并指出：“一个返回符文。”片刻之后，我仍然站着伸出手保持着刚才的动作，指挥官似乎和我一样困惑我们的互动。直到这位战略家最后插嘴说：“你根本不知道你持有的那个符文是怎么运作的，是吗？”

这时，指挥官在意识到情况后眨了眨眼，然后说：“对，你完全是一个新手。”我可以感觉到我脸上的茫然表情，而食人魔似乎意识到了这一点。“到这里来，自然精灵，”一个声音喊道。我转过头去看是谁在叫我，然后注意到是一个我之前帮助过的女食人魔，“让我们看看你得到的符文。”我有点困惑，但还是走了过去，拿出了符文。她一只手拿着，继续检查了一下符文，然后把它还给我。“对，”食人魔开始说，“这个符文是和你结合在一起的，所以只有你才能把它刻在身上。完成后，你可以用符文进入埃尔瓦拉并为我们请求进入的权限。”

我感觉这个食人魔嘴里冒出来的话，像是某种外语。最终，这个后来成为我的老师的食人魔，对符文给出了一系列的解释，最终决定最好还是直接把返回符文铭刻到我身上，而不是给我上一趟符文理论的课。为了确保我在激活符文时遇到最小的麻烦，食人魔选择把它移植到我脖子下面的背上。我记得那次经历是多么痛苦，我脊背上的神经被刺痛刺激。尽管疼痛，我也能记得当我的身体第一次被奥术力量触碰时所感受到的兴奋。

“就这样，结束了。”食人魔对她的工作很满意，绕着我转了一圈，把她的手放在我的肩膀上：“你要做的就是通过这个关卡，向他们提出让我们进入的要求。自然精灵，在我告诉你如何激活符文之前，你要知道，我们感谢你帮助我们走到这一步。如果不是你，我——我们食人魔……我们很可能都死了。”我看到那食人魔脸上的泪水开始往下流，她继续说，“看来我们的生命又一次掌握在你手中了……我希望你能说服永恒精灵人让我们进去，但即使你不能，我也要感谢你，我们都要感谢你。”在我周围，其他食人魔也纷纷低下头来。

我微笑着回答道：“我相信你们会被接纳的，告诉我，我需要做什么。”她抬起头，擦去脸上的泪水，我开始了激活符文的过程。在完成这些步骤之前，我庄严地向食人魔点头。不一会儿，我的周围环境完全改变了，因为我能听到周围永恒精灵的喧闹声。我能感觉到我脖子上刻着符文的地方有一种沉重的感觉，但除此之外，我没有感觉到什么不同。有几个永恒精灵转向我的方向，似乎对我的进入感到惊讶，尽管没有我想象的那么多。其中一个永恒精灵很快喊道：“你就是那个从前帮助我们的自然精灵？欢迎回来！”

“哦，啊，谢谢你，”我回答道，慢慢地适应了我突然进入埃尔瓦拉的事实。很快，我意识到食人魔还在埃尔瓦拉的外面等我。原谅我自己，我继续跑到城市中央，在那里我以前见过将军。尽管我走近时他们认出了我，但楼房外仍像从前一样站着卫兵。我气喘吁吁，喘不过气来，我花了很短的时间吸气和呼气，然后上气不接下气地匆忙说到：“食人魔……寻求庇护……在这里……埃尔瓦拉”我前面的警卫听到我说的那句话后，不知所措地站在那里，似乎领会了我说的话，但无法决定该怎么做。

从我身后传来一个声音：“关于食人魔的什么？”我转过身去，看到一个年轻的女永恒精灵，我认出她是从埃尔瓦拉送我出去的法师之一。看到我，她似乎有点奇怪地冷静，对我说：“哦，你就是那个自然精灵。”。我们从来没有见过面，但不久前我帮你传送出埃尔瓦拉过。欢迎回到埃尔瓦拉。”我屏住呼吸，解释了外面的食人魔，狂热者追逐他们的情况，以及他们是如何寻求在埃尔瓦拉避难的。我说完，年轻的永恒精灵说：“从你告诉我的情况来看，最好尽快把那些食人魔带进来。”

那个女永恒精灵，走近卫兵并和他们交流，他们困惑的脸似乎因为她的言行变得有点痛苦。我不知道法师说了些什么，但似乎卫兵们几乎是在向年轻的永恒精灵女人求情。最后，她叫我跟着她，并开始向我使用返回符文进入城市的方向移动。我猜想，这个永恒精灵似乎有一些计划，一个允许食人魔进入城市的计划。在转身跟在她后面之前，我注意到两个卫兵互相默默无语，在我们走开之后，其中一个冲进楼内，另一个似乎在担忧地看着我和法师的方向。]], "_t")

t([[[i]Alreiwen Taeil the foolhardy enchantress. Easily the worst conversationalist I have ever met, and among all the shaloren I know of none that has a greater ego than hers. Still, I respect her sense of justice as well as her gifted abilities in the arcane. Who knows what fate may have happened to the ogres had she not been present when I made the request for their entry.[/i]

Along the way the young mage probed me with varying questions relating to my travels and the events that I had witnessed or been a part of. Of those questions asked though, the ones involving the treatment of the ogres have stuck out in my mind the most. "So the ogres, I've heard a little bit about them. While they never really traveled here to Elvala, I've heard stories of their altruism and heroics. But, from what you told me about those crazed lunatics, it seems rather odd that they wouldn't have killed the ogres outright. I mean they have obviously managed to merge their bodies with arcane runes, what more reason is there for someone who hates magic to just kill them then and there. For what purpose do you think they would be kept alive?"

I responded coldly to the question, "I do not know the reason, nor do I care. For what purpose would you attempt to discern any meaning from their mad actions anyways? I see little reason for you or any shalore to care." Laughing at this, the young shalore replied "perhaps you are right, but just because these 'cultists' seem to act mad to you, doesn't mean that they pursue whatever their doctrines are aimlessly. They will be our enemies for sure in the future, but hopefully before we ever truly encounter them we can at least know their motives. If we can understand how they act, we can understand what moves they will make, and we can make plans to counter their schemes as a result."

Continuing on, I noticed that the shalore was intently looking at me, or rather at the back of my neck. "Judging from where the rune I crafted was placed, I guess the ogres helped you with inscribing my Rune of Return?" Taking a moment to process what the shalore said, I soon spouted, "You crafted?" The shalore smiled and laughed a bit before continuing, "Indeed I did, a masterwork produced by the best enchantress in Elvala! Though I'm wondering why you didn't graft it on to your own skin yourself, or are the Thaloren really 'that' backwards when it comes to the arcane?" I remember the cold expression I gave, which she immediately picked up on before replying, "Right, I'll try to keep that in mind the next time I meet a thalore."

Nearing the outer edges of Elvala where the Shroud was, the enchantress asked where exactly the ogres would be. I noted to her that I had left them in the same place where I had entered through the Shroud on my first visit, and promptly led her to that spot of my initial entry. Standing stoically, she raised her arms and seemed to sing in a low harmonic sound, and almost immediately the misty smoke began to part. Any skepticism I had as to what she planned was soon replaced with astonishment as a tunnel smaller in size than the one I had traversed formed in front us. From the other side of the tunnel I could see the distant figures of the ogres appear.

Not missing a beat, I could see the ogres begin to move towards us. After a few minutes the first of them began to run inside Elvala's walls before collapsing to the ground. Behind us I noticed a growing crowd of onlookers gathering to witness the unexpected event in front of them. As the last ogre exited from the tunnel, the mage put her arms down, and with it the Shroud fell as well. Finished, she too fell backwards to the ground and gasped heavily for air, seemingly drained of of all her energy after the amazing feat. Looking up at me with a smile on her face she made a simple statement in between deep breaths, "It is done. You have led the ogres to their safety."

"Indeed, though this wasn't the proper way to go about it.” I heard a voice state behind me. Turning around to see the general, I quickly noticed the large company of guards breaking through the onlookers and making our way towards us. For a moment I wondered if there would be trouble, but the general eventually gave the order to the soldiers to help carry the ogres to the healers. As the general began to approach the enchantress his eyes seem to dart quickly towards me. Stopping for a moment to give me a quick look over, he stated in a quiet but authoritative voice, "You should head over with the ogres as well.” before continuing on past me towards the enchantress. Standing above the young shalore as she slowly caught her breathe, I could see him fold his arms.

Deciding for now it would be best to follow the orders of the general, I proceeded to make my way to Elvala's medical facilities as well. Naively thinking I would look for the chief healer and see how I could help out, I made my way into the building, and asked the closest healer where I could find him. I can still remember the shock on the face of the healer's face, as it hadn't even occurred to me at that time that the general had suggested that I head to the healers for my own injuries, not for those of the ogres. It didn't take long for what seemed like one healer after another to be called over, before it seemed like half of the healers in the building were tending to me, including some of those that were originally tending to the ogres.

I can't say I remembered much of what happened either, I couldn't even remember feeling any pain for any of the injuries I apparently had, though the healers recognized how critical those injuries were. I was promptly whisked away to one of the empty beds and given several anesthetic infusions, which subsequently caused me to black out. I would learn later that the healers were aghast at how brutally injured I truly was, but were truly horrified when the regenerative infusions they applied seemingly failed to have much effect, despite how many they applied. It would take my body a few months to recover, not to mention countless infusions. Even to this day I am told to be careful of injury due to how long it takes for me to heal.

Eventually when I woke up, and after the healers had checked me over, I was told to wait as someone wished to visit me. After a period of time I was greeted by the enchantress once more. "I see you are doing alright, you’re certainly quite tough thalore. Don't worry about the ogres, Aranion has granted them the asylum here as requested." She spoke proudly though I could sense a hint of disappointment in her voice. "Now then, I realize you have only woken up, but Aranion wants me to get the story from you as to what transpired after you had left for the Nargol Kingdom to the point when you came back to Elvala. Perhaps as well you might shed some light on why exactly it took you so long to heal as well?"  ]], [[[i]勇敢的女巫阿尔雷温·泰尔。也是我见过的最糟糕的健谈者，在我所认识的所有永恒精灵中，没有人比她更自负。不过，我尊重她的正义感以及她在奥术力量方面的天赋。如果我请求食人魔进入时她不在场，没有人知道他们的命运会怎样。[/i]

一路上，年轻的法师向我提出了各种各样的问题，这些问题与我的旅行以及我所目睹或参与的事件有关。不过，在我提出的这些问题中，那些涉及对食人魔进行治疗的问题在我脑海中最为突出。”所以食人魔，我听说了一些关于他们的事。虽然他们从未真正到过埃尔瓦拉，但我听说过他们的利他主义和英雄事迹。但是，从你告诉我的那些疯狂的疯子看来，他们不直接杀死食人魔这一点似乎很奇怪。我的意思是，他们显然已经将自己的身体和奥术符文结合在一起了，没有什么理由阻止那些讨厌魔法的人在各处屠杀他们。你认为他们为什么会活着？”

我冷冷地回答这个问题，“我不知道原因，也不在乎。不管怎样，你想从他们疯狂的行为中辨别出什么意义？”年轻的永恒精灵笑着说：“也许你是对的，但这些‘邪教徒’在你面前表现如此疯狂，并不意味着他们漫无目的地追求自己的教义。他们在未来肯定是我们的敌人，但希望在真正遇到他们之前，我们至少能知道他们的动机。如果我们能够理解他们的行动方式，就能理解他们将采取什么行动，也就能够因此制定计划来对抗他们的计划。”

接着，我注意到永恒精灵正聚精会神地盯着我，或者更确切地说是盯着我的后颈。“从你把我制作的符文放在哪里来判断，我猜是食人魔帮你刻下了我的回归符文？”我花了一点时间才理解那个永恒精灵说的话，然后叫出声来：“是你制作的？”永恒精灵笑了笑，然后继续说：“当然是我了，埃尔瓦拉最好的女巫创作的杰作！不过，我想知道你为什么不自己把它铭刻到自己的皮肤上，或者说，当涉及到奥术的时候，自然精灵真的是‘这么落后’吗”我露出了冷冰冰的表情，她立即回答道，“好吧，下次我遇到自然精灵的时候，我会尽量记住这一点。”

在靠近埃尔瓦拉帷幕的边缘时，女巫问那些食人魔究竟在哪里。我告诉她，我把他们留在了我第一次来时穿过帷幕进入的地方，并迅速把她带到了我最初进入的那个地方。她坚忍地站着，举起双臂，似乎在低沉的和声中歌唱，迷雾几乎立刻烟消云散。我对她计划的任何怀疑很快就被惊讶所取代，因为一条比我走过的那条小的隧道形成在我们面前。从隧道的另一边我可以看到远处出现的食人魔。

我看到食人魔开始毫不迟疑地向我们跑来。几分钟后，他们中的第一个开始跑进埃尔瓦拉的墙里，然后倒在地上。在我们身后，我注意到越来越多的旁观者聚集在一起，目睹眼前发生的意外事件。当最后一个食人魔从隧道里出来时，法师放下了双手，帷幕也随之合上了。说完，她也倒在地上，喘着粗气，似乎这一惊人的壮举耗尽了她所有的精力后。她仰望着我，脸上带着微笑，在两次深呼吸之后作了一个简单的陈述：“一切都结束了。你把食人魔带到了对他们来说安全的地带。”

“的确，尽管这不是解决问题的正确方法。”我听到身后传来一个声音。转过身去看将军，我很快注意到一大群卫兵冲破围观的人群，朝我们走来。我一时想知道我们会不会有麻烦，但将军最终命令士兵们帮忙把食人魔带到治疗师身边。当将军走进向巫时，他的目光扫过了我。将军停下来，快速看了我一眼，用一种安静但富有权威的声音说：“你也应该和食人魔一起过去。”然后继续从我身边走过，走向女巫。我看到女巫站在年轻的永恒精灵前方，她慢慢地屏住呼吸，双臂合拢。

现在的我决定最好听从将军的命令，我也跟着去了埃尔瓦拉的医疗机构。我天真地认为我应该去找主治医师，看看我能帮上什么忙，就走进楼里，问离我最近的治疗师在哪里能找到他。我仍然记得那个治疗师脸上的震惊，因为当时我甚至没有想到，将军建议我去治疗师那里是为了治疗我自己的伤，而不是那些食人魔的伤。没过多久，一个接一个的治疗师就被叫来了，然后大楼里似乎有一半的治疗师在照顾我，包括一些最初照顾食人魔的人。

我已经不太记得发生过的事情，我甚至记不起我之前受到的那些创伤有什么痛苦，尽管治疗师们很快意识到这些伤害有多严重。我被迅速带到其中一张空床上，给了我几次麻醉剂注射，结果我昏倒了。后来我才知道，治疗师们对我的真实伤势已经感到无比震惊，但当他们发现自己使用的再生纹身似乎没有产生多大效果，无论使用多少的时候，他们的惊讶程度就更大了。我的身体需要几个月才能恢复，更不用说使用了无数次的纹身了。即使到今天，我也被告知要小心受伤，因为我需要更多时间才能痊愈。

最后，当我醒来，在医生检查了我之后，我被告知要稍等一下，因为有人想来看我。过了一段时间，女巫又来迎接我了。“我觉得你做得很好，你确实是一个很坚强的人。不用担心那些食人魔，艾伦尼恩已经按照要求批准了他们在这里避难。”她骄傲地说，虽然我能感觉到她的声音中有一丝失望的味道。“现在，你终于醒了，但艾伦尼恩想让我问问你，有关你离开纳格尔王国回到埃尔瓦拉的路途中，到底发生了什么样的故事。或许，你也可以解释一下，为什么你也要花这么长时间才能痊愈？”]], "_t")

t([[[i]I do not know if Alreiwen has forgiven me, for the terror I had inflicted on her, or the hatred within me she must have felt. While it was but a mere moment, I could tell that all my rage had been channeled into her very being, the same rage that I had filled those fanatics with from before. At that moment I could tell she knew how potentially dangerous I was. Rei, if you are reading this then know how truly sorry I am for what happened.[/i]

For the next two hours, the enchantress proceeded to grill me as to what had happened after I had left Elvala. In great detail I informed her of my experiences within the Nargol Kingdom, and my subsequent travel along the southern shoreline of Maj'Eyal. Every so often the inquisitive shalore would ask me questions about the fanatics I had witnessed and the events I had seen them carry out or suspected them of having a part in. To be honest I couldn't tell if it was for her own satisfaction or perhaps if Aranion had indeed asked her in hopes of learning more about the fanatics. Eventually as our conversation came to a close, that was perhaps when the more eventful part of our discussion came up.

"So, that mostly concludes more or less what Aranion sent me here for,” she began, before continuing to state, "however, the healers also wanted me to ask you a few questions in regards to your body. I'm not sure if you have been told yet, but you have been in this hospital bed for several months now, despite injuries that should have healed in a few weeks. You wouldn't perhaps have an explanation for why this is?" Immediately I wondered if perhaps what had happened on that charred battlefield was connected with the slow recovery time of my body as I had finally begun to realize that something was wrong with me by that point. I can't say I was too interested in talking about that instance, not wanting to remember what had happened either.

"I wouldn't know why that would be.” I replied as I turned my head to look away from the enchantress. Despite not being able to see the shalore's face, I could immediately tell that she saw through me immediately. "So you do have some idea then.” she cheerfully responded. I glanced at her in disgust, noticing a gleam of satisfaction beaming from her eyes, although I couldn't tell what she would be satisfied from. "I'm also guessing that it somehow involves your recent fighting experience, judging from your reactions." I couldn't help but dart my eyes away, realizing that was only telling her how easily and accurately she was reading me. She seemed to giggle a little bit at this, which only served to annoy me and wish that she would go away more.

"The ogres I spoke to talked at great length about how you had led them here to Elvala, of how without your help they would likely not have survived in the fight against their pursuers. However, the more we spoke, the more it became clear that something was amiss. Curiously no ogre would say much in regards to you in whatever battle it was that you fought, despite how important you were to apparently winning it. From what I can understand there were many ogres with you too. How were you so paramount in the ogres getting here? I heard from the Rangers that you held your own against a couple of wolves, but armed fighters are clearly a step above some hungry animals, and you don't strike me as having much in the way of combat experience."

The enchantress intently examined me as she spoke, analyzing me for any hint or clue I would give her. For my part I was actively attempting to repress my memories of those recent events, to not relive the mix of emotions that had taken hold of me at that time, to leave them silent. Intent on digging further into me though, the enchantress continued to press on, to meet that darker version of myself. "What is it that you are hiding about yourself, that the ogres seemingly wouldn't mention about you? What unmentionable thing did you perhaps do to help the ogres through their plight?" The enchantress continued on with the probing questions one after the other, endlessly, never stopping, until finally I decided that she needed to stop.

"CEASE ASKING ME THESE QUESTIONS NOW!" The phrase swiftly escaped from me, though I had no intention of stating it as abruptly or forcefully as I did. The young shalore was immediately taken aback from my statement, her eyes widened and the smile that one could mistake for a permanent fixture on her face now gone. She began to shiver and sweat profusely all at once before stammering out "Wha-What?" She shook in her chair, and I could feel fear emanating from her body. I paused again for a moment, feeling a sense of satisfaction. This sensation I felt, it felt similar from something before. And then I realized all at once what was happening. My emotions were beginning to take a hold of me once more.

Immediately I pulled every force of my being away from the enchantress. She instantly jumped out of the chair and scrambled away from me, gasping as the pressure I had exerted was lifted. Her eyes were wide now, catching a full glimpse of the darker me, and she wanted nothing more than to actively hide away. "I'm sorry" was all I could muster to say. She looked at me, seemingly now appearing much older than before. Shakily she made her way to the door to leave the room, to get to safety, to get away from me. Sometime after she was gone I would realize that a guard would be stationed outside my room, and I'm pretty sure that guard was not there before the enchantress had come.

Eventually as I recovered enough to move around a bit I was finally released from the care of the healers. I was given a dwelling in a secluded part of Elvala and a pair of guards were stationed outside of it at all times. Although I never asked, I was sure they were there to confine me from the rest of the citizens of Elvala, and them from me. I didn't blame the shaloren for this as even now I could feel something driving me, influencing my thoughts, wanting to lash out. Who knows what sort of actions I might have been pushed to do, or whether I may have gone into a mad killing rage against the Shaloren; the irony of which is not lost on me considering my initial reasons for leaving Thaloren lands so long ago.]], [[[i]我不知道阿尔雷温是否原谅了我，原谅我给她带来的恐惧，或者她一定感受到了我内心的仇恨。虽然那只是一瞬间，但我可以看出，我所有的愤怒都已经转移到了她身上，就像我从前对那些狂热分子充满的愤怒一样。在那一刻，她终于意识到了我有多危险。雷，如果你读到这篇文章，你就知道我对所发生的事是多么的抱歉。[/i]

接下来的两个小时里，女巫继续盘问我离开埃尔瓦拉后发生了什么。我非常详细地向她讲述了我在纳格尔王国的经历，以及后来我沿着马基·埃亚尔的南部海岸旅行的经历。好奇的永恒精灵常常会问我一些问题，关于我所目睹的狂热分子，以及我看到他们所进行的、或者怀疑他们参与的事件。老实说，我不知道是艾伦尼恩确实问过她，希望更多地了解狂热分子，还是这一切只是为了满足她自己的好奇心。最后，当我们的谈话接近尾声时，我们谈到了更重要的部分。

“所以，这基本上可以断定，艾伦尼恩派我来这里是为了什么，”她开始继续说，“然而，治疗师也希望我问你几个关于你身体的问题。我不确定他们是否告知了你这件事，但你已经在这张病床上躺了几个月了，尽管几周后你应该会痊愈。你可能没有知道这是为什么？”我很快就想，也许在那烧焦的战场上发生的事情，与我身体恢复缓慢有关，因为我终于开始意识到我当时有点不对劲。然而，我对于谈论那件事情实在并不那么感兴趣，也不想记得发生了什么。

“我不知道为什么会这样。”我转过头去看那个女巫，回答说。尽管我看不见那个永恒精灵的脸，但我可以立刻看出她立刻看穿了我的想法。“看来，你一定知道些什么。”她高兴地回答。我注意到她眼里流露出满足的光芒，厌恶地瞥了她一眼，尽管我不知道她在满足于什么。“从你的反应来看，我也在猜测这可能与你最近的打斗经历有关，“我忍不住把眼睛移开，却意识到这只不过是在告诉她，她对我反应的解读是多么精确。她对此咯咯地笑，这只让我恼火，希望她能多走一点。

“我和那些食人魔聊了很久，谈到你是如何把他们带到埃尔瓦拉的，没有你的帮助，他们很可能无法在与追捕者的战斗中幸存下来。然而，我们说得越多，就越清楚出了问题。奇怪的是，没有一个食人魔谈论你在那场战斗是怎样战斗的，尽管你对于赢得那场战斗显然至关重要。据我所知，你身边也有很多食人魔。你怎么能在食人魔面前这么重要？我从游侠那里听说，你自己对付了几只狼，但武装的战士显然比一些饥饿的动物强大很多，而且你在战斗经验的方面还不如我。”

女巫一边说话，一边仔细地打量着我，分析着我给她的任何暗示和线索。就我而言，我正积极地试图压抑自己对最近那些事件的记忆，不去重温当时控制着我的各种情绪，让它们保持沉默。不过，女巫一心想深入挖掘我的内心深处，继续向我施压，想要看见我那更阴暗的一面。“你在隐藏什么，那些食人魔为什么不愿提起你？你是不是做了什么难以启齿的事，来帮助食人魔渡过难关？”女巫继续一个接一个地问试探性的问题，没完没了地问，从来不停，直到最后我决定她需要停下来。

“别再问我这些问题了！”这句话很快就从我的脑海中消失了，尽管我无意像刚才那样突然或有力地说出来。年轻的永恒精灵立刻被我的话吓了一跳，她的眼睛睁大了，她脸上一直挂着的笑容也突然消失了。她开始颤抖，大汗淋漓，然后结结巴巴地说：“什…什么？”她在椅子上发抖，我能感觉到她身体里流露出的恐惧。我又停顿了一会儿，却感到很满足。我感觉到的这种感觉和以前的感觉很相似。然后我立刻意识到发生了什么：我的情绪又开始控制我了。

我立刻把我所有的力量都从女巫身上拉开。她立刻从椅子上跳下来，从我身边跑了出去，大声喘着气，从我施加的压力中逃离。她现在睁大了眼睛，看到了那个黑暗的我的真相，只想主动躲起来。我唯一能做的只有呢喃着“对不起”。她看着我的样子，似乎刹那间变得比以前老了许多。她摇摇晃晃地走到门口，离开房间，离开我，到了安全的地方。她走后不久，一个警卫开始驻扎在我的房间外面。我敢肯定，在女巫来之前，那里没有这样的警卫。

最后，当我恢复到可以走动的程度时，我终于从治疗师的照顾中解脱出来。我被安排在埃尔瓦拉一个僻静的地方居住，两个卫兵一直驻扎在外面。虽然我从来没有问过，但我确信他们是来把我和埃尔瓦拉的其他市民隔离开来的。我没有责怪永恒精灵，因为即使是现在，我也能感觉到有什么东西在驱使我，影响我的思想，想大发雷霆。没有人知道我会在这样力量的驱使下采取什么样的行动，也不知道我是否会对永恒精灵进行疯狂的杀戮；讽刺的是，这是我很久以前离开自然精灵土地的最初原因。]], "_t")

t([[[i]It is worth noting that there were many ogres in Elvala after my long period of seclusion, hundreds of them even. Apparently the ogres I had rescued had petitioned the Grand Council to seek out as many of their fellow ogres as they could and help them before they were all killed. Agreeing to the request, contact was made with the Nargol Kingdom as well as some Human Kingdoms in the Northwest of Maj'Eyal to secretly help relocate as many of the ogres that could be found to the shrouded Shaloren lands.[/i]

As I finished fully recovering from my injuries, that was truly when I felt I was at the lowest point in my life. Having all the time in the world to think, I could not stop myself from remembering the events that had happened since that day when the Spellblaze occurred up to the present moment. Every waking minute felt as if I was dreaming, whether I was asleep or awake, yet this nightmare was real and deep within I could feel the urges that I had felt afflicting me when I fought against the fanatics trying to claw their way to the surface now. I was in a state of indescribable agony, seemingly hating more and more about my life, yet having no clue how to free myself from either my emotions or the cage I had been put in.

It wasn't until a few months had passed when a visitor would come to see me. I could hear outside the guards talking to someone, and from the distinctly deeper tone of the voice I figured it must have been one of the ogres. After a moment the guards let my visitor in and I immediately recognized the ogre strategist as he entered. With a solemn face he began to speak, "How are you then, thalore? It took some time but I was finally granted permission to meet with you. Likely if it wasn't for you we ogres would certainly all be dead now, or worse. We never got to properly thank you for saving us after you lead us to safety here in Elvala, and yet while we you freed from imprisonment, we perhaps led to you to your own."

As the strategist spoke those last words he paused to bow his head, and I could sense every ounce of his sadness in that brief moment. Regaining his previous composure though, the strategist raised his head once more to speak, "We figured we would have a celebration for everyone. After all that has happened, everyone is in need of a good dose of cheer to take our minds off everything." Finishing the first sentence the ogre looked at me, as if to add one important addition to it, "And from what I have heard, you need something to take your mind off past events as well." I had barely clued in that I was receiving anything more than gratitude from the strategist, but upon hearing that I realized I was being invited to a gathering of people.

Would 'I' be okay I thought? Could I potentially lash out again at someone? "I don't know if that would be a good idea..." I trailed off, hoping my uneasiness would be conveyed and not any of the anger or other emotions that bubbled inside me. Seeing it instead as a moment to speak the ogre chimed in, "Because you don't know if you will be able to control yourself and have another incident like with that enchantress?" Taken a bit off guard by this, my eyes grew wide. Yet the strategist said nothing, continuing to stand there with the same solemn face that he had entered with. Recovering from his statement I turned away as I stated, "I don't want to hurt anybody. It would probably be better if I stayed away, the less contact I have with anyone the better."

My words perhaps hit me the hardest when I said them. I hadn't realized it until that moment since I had been busy trying to keep a handle on myself but I was talking as if I was ready to become a recluse. I had spent three months here lamenting my situation, and yet now I was pushing away a chance to free myself from it? All at once I immediately began to feel hate, hatred similar to all the unfortunate incidents I had been a part of. But unlike before where I had directed my hatred at others, I had no one to feel hatreds towards here- "Except yourself?" I blanked for a moment when the ogre said those two words, seemingly connecting with my thoughts as perfectly as they did. I didn't know if it was a good idea or not but for a brief moment the hatred I felt within me faded.

Getting up and looking at the strategist I firmly stated, "I accept your offer." The ogre strategist seemed to become ecstatic at this, immediately taking my arm, and making way to the door. I couldn't decide if I was perhaps being led or simply dragged by the overly enthusiastic ogre to wherever the festivities were, but I certainly felt happier at that point than I had been in a long while. In the back of my mind I thought that if there was a chance for my condition to improve, it would perhaps be through the interaction with others. At the very least it was a way out of my seclusion and perhaps I could get my mind off of the many past events that were now haunting me.

Drawing closer to one of Elvala's main fields I could hear the voices and sounds of rhythmic beating up ahead, and I could see a gathering crowd of both shalore and ogre. Attentive faces were fixed on a group of a dozen ogres in the middle of the part. Observing the ogres, I noticed that they were performing a very slow, synchronized, and captivating dance. Those viewing the ogres seemed to be in little spirit, yet as the ogres continued to perform, gradually picking up the pace of their performance. Little by little the ogres would move faster before they encourage the crowd to join them by clapping. Slowly as those around began to clap the mood of the crowd began to improve until I could see smiles cracking from a few of their faces.

As the ogres finished their dance, a couple shalore decided to step forward and entertain the crowds. One began to sing a pleasing chord and then stop, then the other began to sing the same chord but at a lower frequency. Upon finishing the second chord, both shalore began to sing their chords, harmonizing them to produce a beautiful melody that washed over the crowd. Within myself, it felt as if I could hear nothing but my own thoughts for once. As the performances continued I felt as if I was regaining pieces of myself that I had once lost. Without a doubt, the affliction that had taken a hold of me was still there, but with each moment it felt less and less significant. For the first time in a long while I felt happiness, and even as the festivities died down and ended I continued to feel happy.

Making my way back to my dwelling I felt in control of myself and my actions. Whatever the enigma within me was, it did not and would not lord over me. As I came up to the guards I smiled and gave a friendly gesture. While I was heading back in for now, I knew that I would leave this dwelling again tomorrow. While the ogres are quick to note that I had saved them when conversation touches on past events, in reality I believe that they were the ones who had actually saved me. The ogres are quick to dismiss this as modesty, but since that time when I was at that festival I have been working to gain full control over my myself, to take a hold of my life once more. For that I say thank you to them.]], [[[i]值得注意的是，在我长期的隐居之后，埃尔瓦拉来了更多食人魔，甚至有数百人。显然，我所救的食人魔已经向大议会请愿，要求尽可能多地寻找他们的同类食人魔，并在他们全部被杀之前帮助他们。他们同意了这一要求，与纳格尔王国以及马基·埃亚尔西北部的一些人类王国取得了联系，秘密帮助将尽可能多的食人魔转移到被帷幕笼罩的永恒精灵土地上。[/i]

当我完全从伤病中恢复过来时，我真的感觉到自己正处在人生的最低谷。有了那么多的时间去思考，我无法阻止自己回忆起从那一天起发生的事情，那一天的一幕幕景象仿佛直到现在都在发生着。每一个醒着的时刻，无论我是睡着了还是醒着，我都仿佛在做梦，然而这场噩梦却是真实的，在我内心深处，我能感受到当我与那些狂热分子战斗时，我所感受到的那种折磨我的冲动正在时刻浮现。我处于一种无法形容的痛苦之中，似乎越来越讨厌我的生活，但却不知道如何从我的情绪和我被关在的笼子里解脱出来。

直到几个月过去了，才有人来看我。我能听到外面的卫兵在跟人说话，从那明显较深的声音里，我猜出那一定是一位食人魔。过了一会儿，卫兵让我的访客进来，我立刻认出了进来的食人魔战略家。他严肃地说：“你怎么样，自然精灵？过了一段时间，我终于获准与你见面。如果不是你，我们食人魔现在肯定都死了，或者更糟。在你把我们带到埃尔瓦拉的安全地带之后，我们从未有机会感谢你救了我们，然而，当你终于能够解除监禁之后，我们希望把你带到你自己的地方。”

当战略家说出最后几句话时，他停下来低下头，我能感觉到他在那短暂的时刻的每一份悲伤。不过，这位战略家恢复了先前的镇定，再次抬起头说：“我们以为大家都会庆祝一下。在这一切发生之后，每个人都需要一场欢呼，来让我们忘却一切，你也需要一些东西来忘掉过去的事情。”我本来只希望得到战略家的感谢，但听到这句话，我意识到我被邀请参加一个聚会。

我在想，“我”真的会没事吗？我还会像之前一样，向某个人无端宣泄怒火吗？“我不知道这是否是一个好主意……”我拖着脚步走了，希望我的不安能被传达出来，而不是我内心涌起的愤怒或其他情绪。看到这是一个说话的机会，食人魔附和道：“因为你不知道你是否能控制自己，并且在那个女巫的身上，你遇到了同样的事情？”我被这件事弄得有点措手不及，眼睛睁大了。然而，这位战略家什么也没说，继续站在那里，脸上带着他进来时那副严肃的样子。从他的陈述中恢复过来，我拒绝了，说道：“我不想伤害任何人。我应该待在家里，和别人的接触越少越好。”

当我说这些话的时候，我才意识到这些话对我的打击。因为我一直忙着控制自己，直到那一刻，我才意识到这一点，我说的这些话好像在准备让我成为一个隐士。我在这里花了三个月的时间为我的处境感到惋惜，但现在，我却在放弃一个摆脱困境的机会？突然间，我开始感到仇恨，就像仇恨我曾经参与过的所有不幸事件一样。但这不像以前我把我的仇恨指向别人的时候，在这里，这些仇恨没有任何指向的对象——“除了你自己？”当食人魔说出这几个字时，我愣住了一会儿，似乎和我的思想一样完美地联系在一起。我不知道这是不是个好主意，但我内心的仇恨在一瞬间消失了。

我站起身来，看着战略家，坚定地说：“我接受你的提议。”食人魔战略家似乎对此欣喜若狂，立即抓住我的胳膊，向门口走去。我不清楚该说，我是被这只过于热情的食人魔牵着，还是被它拖到了节日的各个地方，但我在那一刻确实感到比很久以前更快乐了。在我的脑海里，我想如果有机会让我的状况得到改善，也许是通过与他人的互动。至少这是我摆脱隐居的一条出路。也许，我可以忘掉许多过去一直萦绕在我心头的事情。

走近埃尔瓦拉的中央广场，听到一阵有节奏的鼓点和旋律传来，那里聚集着一群永恒精灵和食人魔。人们专注着看着中央的一群正在表演的食人魔。看着这些食人魔，我注意到他们正在表演一种非常缓慢，同步，迷人的舞蹈。那些观看食人魔表演的人一开始似乎没有什么精神，但随着食人魔继续表演，他们的表演速度逐渐加快。一点一点地，食人魔的速度越来越快，鼓掌激励人群加入他们。慢慢地，周围的人也开始鼓掌，人群的情绪开始好转，直到我能看到他们脸上露出的笑容。

当食人魔们完成了他们的舞蹈后，一对永恒精灵夫妇决定向前一步，用音乐给大家带来欢乐。一个开始唱悦耳的和弦，然后停下来，然后另一个开始唱同一个和弦，但频率较低。第二个和弦结束后，两个永恒精灵同时唱起他们的和弦，使之和谐起来，产生了一个优美的旋律，在人群中荡漾。刹那间，在我内心深处，我仿佛能够听到自己内心伸出的想法。随着表演的继续，我感觉自己好像在找回曾经失去的自我。毫无疑问，折磨着我的痛苦仍然存在，但每一刻都感觉不那么重要。很长一段时间以来，我第一次感到幸福，即使节日结束了，我仍然感到幸福。

回到我的住处，我感觉自己和我的行为都在控制之中。无论我内心的谜团是什么，它没有，也不会主宰我。当走到警卫面前时，我微笑着做了一个友好的手势。当我回去的时候，我相信自己明天会再次离开这所房子。虽然食人魔在谈论过去的事情时谈起我救了他们，但实际上我相信，他们才是真正救了我的人。食人魔们很快就把这当作是一种谦虚，但自从我参加那个节日以来，我一直在努力完全控制自己，重新掌控自己的生活。为此我向他们表示感谢。]], "_t")

t([[[i]As time passed, both ogre and shalore slowly adapted to their secluded lives from the outside world.[/i] The shaloren slowly gathered themselves and their belongings in secret from the abandoned settlements in the north, and then quickly worked to create permanent implements that would ensure that the Shroud concealing Elvala would stay in place. They then worked to expand the Shroud to encompass all the forests surrounding Elvala and lock off the Shaloren Peninsula from the outside world. After that, many shaloren began to study the chaotic energies that had been unleashed in hopes of learning more about the damage they had caused and what effects it would leave in Eyal.

[i]The ogres settled down in the southern portions of the peninsula to rebuild new lives for themselves.[/i] They helped to grow and harvest food to feed everyone and took up more laborious occupations that the shaloren were ill-suited to perform. Many gave birth to children, resulting in a great many young ogres helping to bolster their limited numbers. Some of the ogres also took up occupations working with inscriptions, and while my knowledge of runes is still quite limited, I could tell from their workmanship that their knowledge and skills with infusions were as good as many of the thaloren I knew back home. Despite some disagreements the ogres had, they managed to create a thriving relationship with the shaloren, one that I hope will last for a long time to come.

[i]In regards to myself, I want to one day leave Elvala and venture back out into the world.[/i] I know though that if I was to leave I would need to know how to properly defend myself, in case I ever ran into those fanatics or some other foul group that would seek to cause myself or others harm. I also wished to learn about the rune magic that the ogres had used, and whether it could be something I myself may want to employ. Finally I couldn't ignore the nagging affliction which influences me, as I knew that if I ever lost control and had my emotions consume me once more that I may lash out against those who I did not mean to. With this in mind I sought the help of those around me, looking to learn whatever they may teach me.

I was surprised to find that when approached about this, both the shaloren and the ogres were quite willing to teach me. Back home few were interested in sharing their knowledge with others for any reason, and this included even between family members. The exception to this of course was where a necessity to Thaloren society existed, such as in times of war or other calamity, but even then it was limited. I will note though that the shaloren I approached tended to request something in exchange for teaching me, usually asking for monetary compensation. The ogres on the other hand that I talked to were quite open in sharing their knowledge, and in fact one in particular seemed almost overly eager to do so.

This was when my instructor, the female ogre who had helped graft my Rune of Return on my neck, approached me offering to give me a full breakdown on the use of runes and their applications. I was told about the variety of runes that existed and the various abilities they could employ. I also learned about the basics of their use, being lectured on how they would gather a bodies innate inner magic into arcane energy, convert that arcane energy into the magical effect that the rune would employ, and need time to repeat the process again. On top of this a rune would create a magical buildup within the body which would make subsequent rune use more and more difficult for the user to do.

My instructor was also keen to give me a hands on demonstration regarding the use of runes to ensure I truly understood how they would work. I remember when we first started out how she abruptly disappeared from in front of me, how I subsequently looked around aimlessly before hearing her laugh in front of me as she reappeared again. I would be introduced to several ogres who would show me the multitude of abilities that their runes would grant them and hear stories of how they had used their runes in past scuffles or brawls. Finally, my instructor offered to give me a rune for my own personal use, a heat beam rune. Unlike how my instructor had grafted the Rune of Return onto me before, I inscribe that rune onto my left arm myself, and it is still with me to this day.

From the shaloren I would learn various skills, specifically in regards combat equipment. A weaponsmith gave me some rudimentary lessons on how to wield and orient a weapon in combat before getting me to practice for hitting training dummies with everything from large swords and hammers to small daggers and clubs. From an armorsmith I was shown various pieces of clothing and armor and shown the varying effectiveness these armors had when hit with weapons. I even got to run a small training course decked out in full set of plate armor that the armorsmith lent me to learn how to maneuver and run around without completely exhausting myself.

Eventually some veteran shaloren soldiers offered to spar with me too. From that moment I took everything that I had learned and put it all into practice. For a time I would engage in mock battles, learning how to regulate my stamina and when to use runes to give myself and advantage in combat, or just to make up for disadvantages that I might be suffering. It wasn't long before I could hold my own in combat even against battle hardened trained soldiers, at which point I was promptly asked if I would be interested in enlisting in the Shaloren Military. Not having much to do and figuring it would help in advancing my combat skills I accepted, and for several years I would serve as a soldier in Elvala.

It would also be within the military that I would get to learn a great deal about controlling my emotions. Enrolled in a program for those with unique abilities, I would slowly begin to learn more about the dark condition affecting my body and how I could use it to my advantage. I would learn about how I could effect my surroundings, both inanimate and living, and in some cases I would even be allowed to practice trying to use the dark thoughts inside me against others. I can't say I ever gained full control over the chaotic energies within me, but through concentration I would learn how to at least direct it away from others and prevent it from affecting people in my vicinity.

When I look back at the many events the occurred after the Spellblaze, I wonder what life might have held for me had I not left to travel as I did. Much time has now passed since the time of my initial journey, but I consider whether now is the time that I will leave Elvala to explore distant lands and see what has become of everything in the world. I wonder how the rest of the people in Eyal are faring and whether the lands have shown any signs of healing, as well as wonder what has happened to my fellow thaloren back home. Whatever may lie in my future I know that I am ready to make my way through it. And when I do, my escapades will continue once more!]], [[[i]随着时间的推移，食人魔和永恒精灵慢慢适应了他们与世隔绝的生活。[/i]永恒精灵慢慢地把自己和他们的东西从北方被遗弃的定居点秘密地收集起来，然后迅速工作，创造出永久性的工具，以确保隐藏埃尔瓦拉的帷幕可以永久维持。他们随后努力扩大帷幕，将埃尔瓦拉周围的所有森林包围起来，并从外部世界封锁了永恒精灵半岛。在那之后，许多永恒精灵开始研究他们曾经释放出来的混乱能量，希望更多地了解它们造成的伤害，以及它会给埃亚尔留下什么影响。

[i]食人魔在半岛南部定居下来，为自己重建新的生活。[/i]他们帮助种植和收获食物来养活每一个人，并从事永恒精灵不适合从事的更辛苦的工作。许多人生下了孩子，产生了许多年轻的食人魔，来尽快弥补他们有限的人口。一些食人魔也从事与符文和纹身有关的职业，虽然我对符文的知识还相当有限，但我可以从他们的手艺中看出，他们的知识和技能与我在家乡认识的许多自然精灵一样好。尽管食人魔之间存在一些分歧，但他们还是设法与永恒精灵建立了一种繁荣的关系，我希望这种关系能持续很长一段时间。

[i]就我自己而言，我想有一天离开埃尔瓦拉，在这个世界上冒险。[/i]但我知道，如果我要离开，我需要知道如何正确地保护自己，以防我遇到那些狂热分子或其他邪恶集团，或是给自己或他人造成伤害。我还想了解食人魔使用的符文魔法，以及它是否可能是我自己想使用的东西。最后，我不能忽视影响我的烦恼，因为我知道，如果我失去控制，让我的情绪再次控制我，我可能会伤害那些我不想伤害的人。有鉴于此，我寻求周围人的帮助，希望能学到他们教我的一切。

我很惊讶地发现，当我考虑这件事时，永恒精灵和食人魔都很愿意教我。在自然精灵那里，很少有人有兴趣与他人分享他们的知识，甚至在家庭成员之间也不愿传授。当然，在战争时期或其他灾难的时候，为了维持自然精灵社会的存续，也会出现一些例外，但即使如此，它也是有限的。我注意到，我接触的永恒精灵往往要求一些东西来交换，通常会要求收受学费。另一方面，我所说的食人魔在分享他们的知识方面也相当开放，事实上，其中一个人似乎特别急切与与我分享知识。

这就是我的老师，一个帮助我将返回符文移植到我脖子上的女食人魔。她找到我，提出要给我一个关于符文的使用和应用的详细说明。她教会了我各种符文的存在，以及它们可以使用的各种能力。我还学习了它们的基本使用方法，并被教导如何将身体内在的法力转化为奥术能量，将奥术能量转化为符文将使用的魔法效果，并需要时间再次重复这个过程。在此基础上，一个符文将在身体内创造一个奥术结构，这将使得随后的符文使用越来越困难。

我的老师也很乐意给我演示如何使用符文，以确保我真正理解它们的工作原理。我记得我们刚开始的时候，她突然从我面前消失了，后来我漫无目的地四处张望，然后看到她再次出现时在我面前，对我大笑。我将被介绍给几个食人魔，他们将向我展示他们的符文所赋予的众多能力，并讲述他们如何在过去的纷争与战斗中使用他们的符文。最后，我的老师给了我一个供我个人使用的符文，一个热能射线符文。不像我的老师以前把回归符文铭刻到我身上，我亲自把它刻在我的左臂上，直到今天它仍然伴随着我。

从永恒精灵那里，我学习了各种技能，特别是在战斗装备方面的技能。一个武器匠教会了了我一些基本的课程，教我如何在战斗中挥舞和使用武器，然后让我练习用从大刀和锤子到小匕首和棍棒的各种武器打击训练假人。在一个铸甲师那里，我看到了各种各样的衣服和盔甲，并展示了这些盔甲在被武器击中时的不同效果。我甚至还得参加一个小型的训练课程，穿着铸甲师借给我的全套装甲，学习如何在不完全耗尽自己体力的情况下进行机动和跑动。

最后，一些永恒精灵的老兵也提出要和我交锋。从那一刻起，我把学到的一切都付诸实践。有一段时间，我会参加模拟战斗，学习如何调节我的体力，何时使用符文给自己在战斗中施加优势，或者弥补我在战斗中的不利局面。不久之后，我就可以自己作战，即使是对训练有素的士兵也毫不逊色。在这个时候，他们很快问我，我是否有兴趣加入永恒精灵军队。因为我没有太多的事情要做，觉得这将有助于提高我的战斗技能，我接受了，几年来，我一直作为一名士兵在埃尔瓦拉服役。

我也在军队里学到很多控制情绪的方法。我参加了一个为那些有独特能力的人而设的项目，慢慢地开始更多地了解影响我身体的黑暗状况，以及如何让这种力量为我所用。我学习了如何影响我的周围环境，包括无生命的和有生命的，在某些情况下，我甚至会被允许练习用我内心的黑暗思想来对付别人。我不能说我已经完全控制了我内心的混乱能量，但通过集中注意力，我将学会如何至少把它从别人身边引开，防止它影响到我周围的人。

当我回顾魔法大爆炸之后发生的许多事情时，我不知道如果我没有像以前那样离开家乡去旅行，我的生活会怎样。从我最初的旅程到现在，已经过去了很多时间，但我想，未来我将会有机会离开埃尔瓦拉去探索遥远的土地，看看世界上的一切都变成了什么样。我想知道埃亚尔的其他人是怎么生活的，这些土地是否显示出任何治愈的迹象，也想知道我在家乡的其他自然精灵的身上发生了什么。不管将来会发生什么，我知道我已经准备好了。当那个时候到来的时候，我将会继续我的冒险！]], "_t")

t([[[i]Truly there is nothing more horrid than the experience of encountering ghouls. You will likely smell them as they emit a horrible stench, else if you are lucky you'll just hear them as they groan in a low painful sounding tone. Casting your eyes upon them you will be presented with a truly horrible display as you witness rows of hanging flesh and dripping puss surrounding a vaguely humanoid figure. The worst of it though is the touch and feel of ghouls. I bet any ordinary individual would feel grossly unsettled just poking them with a stick, let alone engaging up close to them in combat as I did.[/i]

As I walked along the treeline I recounted the events that had led me to these daily patrols. Thirty-three long years passed after the cataclysm of the Spellblaze, the moment still burning within my mind, as well as my body. I survived the destruction and the events that followed, and had come to find myself in Elvala among the shaloren, whom I had come to care for and be in the care of. I had fallen in love with one of the soldiers whom I had trained with and had come to know him as family. Yet I wondered how the rest outside of Elvala suffered, how those thaloren at home fared, and if I should leave to explore the world again as I had once desired to.

Returning from my patrol towards the old path that cut through the forest I noticed a couple of Elvala's officials and a cadre of guards in the distance. Approaching them I soon noticed what looked to be a rotting body at their feet. Glancing towards the body I felt a coldness, a dark force that felt worse than anything I had every experienced, including the chaotic energies within me. Catching sight of me, one of the officials turned towards me and stated in a direct voice, "Fay, I need you to quickly exit through the Shroud, take a quick look around, and report back anything unusual you see." Sensing some urgency to this request I promptly turned towards the Shroud and dove in without a second thought.

Traveling through the misty smoke I recalled the first time I had left Elvala. I had traveled through this magical barrier many times to rescue those who had found themselves stranded outside the wall or to act as an escort for Nargol emissary's and traders, but I could feel as though there was a great tension around me. For the next two hours I slowly traversed through the smoke with only my thoughts to keep my company until at last I reached the other side and began to see the outside world ahead begin to unfurl itself. Nearing the outer edges of the smoke I heard a guttural sound bellow out nearby, before I glimpsed a gaunt figure jumped over towards me, swinging its arms in my direction.

Unable to immediately dodge the attack, one of the arms connected with my chest, hitting me with immense strength. The strike reverberated through my steel breastplate, shaking the whole of my body, and throwing me completely off balance. Seemingly not missing a beat the creature threw its face towards my arm, clamping down hard with its teeth, and somehow biting through my steel gauntlets. Pain seared through my left arm, and something more seemed to course through my body, sapping my strength and making me sluggish. I did not know who this attacker was but I could feel the hatred inside me beginning to build. All that was left to do was to unleash it.

Beginning to counterattack I activated the heat beam rune in my left hand. The creature quickly detached from my arm and began to cry out as flames engulfed all around it. Immediately following this I began to hit the creature with a fury of blows that quickly overwhelmed the creature as it flailed widely in an attempt to attack back. Pressing my advantage I struck the creature with a devastating swipe that cut hard across its body. I paused for a moment as I expected the creature to keel over dead, but was surprised when the creature seemed to bounce back and try one more time to attack me. I dodged this attack with ease though and with a simple slash I partially separated its head from its body, finally killing it.

Finally having a chance to closely examine the creature, I noticed a single eye staring out from one of the eye sockets. Blinking and looking at the rest of its body I realized I had been fighting a rotting corpse. I wondered if there were anymore undead and I began to look around my immediate area. Around me I could spot a few sparse dead corpses mingling about that had yet to notice my presence. Deciding I would dispatch them I attempted to quietly approach them, only to realize how difficult this would be due to all the muddy ground in the area. It was at this point though when I wondered why all the ground was muddy, before I discerned the many tracks and footprints, all leading into the Shroud.

Realizing the danger that was headed to Elvala, I quickly activated the Rune of Return that I had been grafted by the ogres on my neck, and in an instant I was once again within the city walls. Before I could reacquire my bearings a shaloren soldier walked into me and knocked me to the ground. The soldier soon got to his feet saying "My apologies" and proceeded to extend a hand under my left shoulder to help me up. Noticing the festering bite marks on my arm, the eyes of the soldier soon gained a solemn look and continuing to talk stated, "Command will want your report immediately on the undead you encountered. We've had a few more wander in through the Shroud while you were scouting."

I turned towards the soldier who nodded in the direction of the main battlement line facing towards Elvala's northern forests. Nodding back, I proceeded to make my way to the tower above the main gate where I suspected the watch captain would be. I quickly made my way through the host of gathering soldiers forming below the walls and made my way up along with the mages and archers who were climbing the stairs to get to their positions. Noticing me as I made my way up, the watch captain called out in my direction, and I hurried over to his position to relay to him what had occurred. The captain tensed his face as I gave him my report and cursed as he turned his head to look out towards the Shroud.]], [[[i]真的没有什么比遇到食尸鬼更可怕的了。如果你幸运的话，你只会听到它们低沉痛苦的呻吟声，否则你可能会闻到它们散发出可怕的臭味。把你的眼睛投向他们，你将看到一个真正可怕的怪物，那是浑身覆盖着腐肉，滴下恶臭脓液的怪物。但最糟糕的是食尸鬼的触摸和感觉。我敢打赌，任何一个普通人只要用棍子戳他们，都会感到非常不安，更不用说像我那样在战斗中与他们亲密接触了。[/i]

当我沿着树林走的时候，我记起了导致我参加这些日常巡逻的事件。魔法大爆炸的灾变已经过去了三十三年，但这一刻的痛苦仍然在我的头脑和身体中燃烧。我在这场灾难和随后发生的事件中幸存了下来，来到了埃尔瓦拉，来到了我所关心和照顾的永恒精灵中间。我爱上了一个和我一起训练的士兵，后来和他一起组成了家庭。然而，我想知道埃尔瓦拉以外的其他人是如何受苦的，家里的那些自然精灵是如何生活的，我想，我也许应该像我曾经希望的那样，再次离开这里去探索这个世界。

在巡逻返回穿过森林的老路上，我注意到远处有两名埃尔瓦拉的官员和一名警卫。走近他们时，我很快注意到他们脚下有一具腐烂的尸体。我瞥了一眼身体，感觉到一种寒冷，一种黑暗的力量，比我所经历过的任何事情都要糟糕，包括我内心的黑暗能量。看到我，一个官员转向我，直截了当地说：“菲，我需要你迅速地从帷幕中离开，快速地巡视周围，然后报告你看到的任何不寻常的东西。”我感受到这一请求的急切，于是立即转向帷幕，毫不犹豫地走了进去。

在迷雾弥漫的烟雾中旅行，我想起了我第一次离开埃尔瓦拉的情景。我曾多次穿过这道魔法的屏障，去营救那些被困在墙外的人，或是为纳格尔的使者和商人充当护卫，但我能感觉到周围有一种巨大的紧张气氛。在接下来的两个小时里，我慢慢地穿过烟雾，只想着我的任务，直到最后到达另一边，看到前方的外部世界开始展现出来。在靠近烟的外缘时，我听到附近传来一声喉音，然后我瞥见一个憔悴的人影朝我扑过来，双臂朝我的方向摆动。

我未能立即躲开攻击，一条手臂打向了我的胸口，以巨大的力量击中了我。那一击在我的钢制胸甲里回荡，震动了我的全身，使我完全失去了平衡。这生物似乎没有错过任何机会，脸朝我的胳膊扑过去，用牙齿使劲咬住，不知怎的咬破了我的钢臂铠。我的左臂疼痛难忍，似乎还有更多的东西流入了我的身体，耗尽了我的力量，使我行动迟缓。它不知道袭击者是谁，但我能感觉到我内心的仇恨开始积聚。剩下要做的就是释放它。

我准备开始反击，激活了左手的热能射线符文。那生物很快从我的手臂上挣脱出来，火焰吞噬它的四周，它开始大叫起来。紧接着，在它大举挥舞着手臂试图反击的时候，我对他施展了狂怒的一击，很快就把它击倒了。我使出浑身解数猛击那生物，狠狠地划破了它的身体。我停了一会儿，以为那生物会倒下死去，但它的身躯似乎又反弹回来，试图攻击我，我感到无比惊讶。不过，我轻松地躲过了这次袭击，我用一个简单的斩击将它的头部和身体部分切开，最后杀死了它。

终于，我有机会仔细观察这只动物。我注意到它的一只眼睛从其中一个眼窝向外瞪着。我眨着眼睛，看着它的其他部分，终于意识到我一直在和一具腐烂的尸体搏斗。我想知道周围是否还有不死生物，于是开始环顾周围。在我的周围，我可以看到一些稀稀拉拉的死尸混在一起，它们还没有注意到我的存在。我决定干掉他们，试图悄悄地接近他们，但意识到这将是一件多么困难的事，因为这里的土地满是泥泞。就在这个时候，我开始思考为什么所有的地面都是泥泞的，然后我才发现许多足迹和脚印，都通向帷幕内。

意识到它们正在前往埃尔瓦拉的这一危险，我很快启动了食人魔印刻在我脖子上的返回符文，一瞬间，我再次出现在在城墙内。我还没来得及认清自己的方位的时候，一个永恒精灵士兵就走近我，把我打倒在地。士兵很快站起身来，说了声“我我很抱歉”，然后在我的左肩下伸出一只手来扶我起来。注意到我手臂上的溃烂的咬痕，士兵的眼睛很快严肃起来，继续说道：“司令部希望你立即报告你遇到的不死生物。你在侦察的时候，我们又在帷幕里碰到了几只。”

我转向士兵，他面向埃尔瓦拉的北部森林，朝着主城垛的方向点了一下头。我点了点头，继续向大门上方的塔楼走去，守望队长应该就在那里。我很快穿过墙下聚集的士兵，和那些正在爬楼梯的法师和弓箭手们一起爬上去。当我走上前去时，守望队长注意到我，朝我的方向叫了一声，我急忙跑到他的位置，把发生的事转告他。当我把报告交给队长时，他绷紧了脸，把头转向帷幕外，发出了一句咒骂。]], "_t")

t([[[i]Looking past the gruesome nature of the undead, I can somewhat appreciate the brilliance of the tactics and strategy that they employed. Everything seemed to have been meticulously planned out beforehand and being undead they were able to act perfectly in a preordained manner. This allowed the necromancer controlling them to stay safely out of harms way and away for the duration of the battle.[/i]

Suddenly I noticed the captain's eyes narrow and lock onto something within the smoke and turning to look myself I noticed the quivering distortions. Suddenly, with a loud call to "FIRE" coming from the watch captain, the many archers and mages began to loose arrows and cast spells, causing the disturbance to turn into a whirling maelstrom as projectiles and magic slammed into it. Despite the barrage a glistening phalanx of moving bones and tattered armor emerged, revealing several rows of skeletons in a defensive formation. Holding their shields high above them, they moved within lockstep of each other, and slowly made their approach towards the wall.

The defenders continued to unleash everything they could over the walls, but for every single skeleton that was shattered or had its bones scattered across the battlefield it seemed as if two more would emerge behind it. Being unliving enemies with no free will of their own they continued to advance towards us no matter how many of them fell. Approaching the walls, soldiers from below began to cart up rocks and stones into great piles, and as the skeletons got closer the soldiers began to throw the debris over the walls. Unlike with arrows and spells, the skeletons could not overcome the heavy weight dropping down on them and many would be subsequently crushed.

Looking down at them, the captain seem to muse over the situation before muttering, "I don't see them carrying any ladders, but judging from how they marched to the walls they must have some plan." Continuing to monitor them, I noticed hoarse voices in the air, and all of a sudden nearby panicked voices from those on the wall began to call out that they were under attack. Looking around I couldn’t see any attackers but I could tell that there were foes nearby. Then all at once I could feel the faint presence of something moving behind me and the watch captain. Quickly pulling my weapon I slashed behind me at the space where one of them was and though I couldn't see the enemy I heard a low gasp as my weapon slashed through the air.

Becoming aware of what was happening, the watch captain called out to the defenders on the battlements, "We are under attack by shades, defend yourselves!" All at once everyone on the battlements turned to deal with the new threat and ignore the skeletons below. Those that could determine where the hidden enemies were quickly focused their attacks on dispatching the enemies directly while those that couldn't unleashed attacks in wide arcs that would be difficult to evade. It wasn't long before a torrent of death cries filled the air, but it would soon become clear that these enemies were just a distraction as skeletons made their move, constructing ladders and forming pyramids made of bones.

Now with means to get to us, the skeletons were clambering up and arriving onto the battlements, using their superior numbers to push us back. Seeing that we were being overwhelmed, the watch captain gave the order to abandon the walls, causing everyone to scramble in an attempt to get off in whatever way possible. Unfortunately in the confusion, many who were still engaged or injured were unable to get away, and were subsequently hacked to pieces. Having lost control of the battlements, a small force of the skeletons moved to take over the gates and allow for the rest of the undead outside to get in, while the rest of the skeletons began to jump off in pursuit of us in a bid to run us down.

As we ran down one of Elvala's narrow streets, the watch captain saw an opportunity present itself, and ordered the mages to form a firing line. Following us, the skeletons funneled into the streets after us into a tight formation, presenting a perfect opportunity for a barrage of spells to be used against them. Waves of lightning, fire, and cold spells washed over that battlefield and sent their bones scattering all over the street. Seeing most of the skeletons vanquished the defenders broke into a resounding cheer, until realization set in that there was more to come. Looking past the fallen skeletons, we could see a torrent of undead now flooding through the gate.

The guttural sounds of ghouls began to fill the air and along with these ghouls walked another couple legions of skeletons. However, it was behind them that a truly frightening undead began to move, hulking figures of towering bone that stood as high as many of Elvala's buildings. A final line of skeletons also appeared too, but unlike the others they appeared to be armed with staves and bows. Quickly the undead began to organize themselves before moving lockstep with each other in our direction. Our mages attempted to ready another set of spells but quickly found this quite difficult as arrows and spells from the undead rained down on them. Realizing we would have to engage the undead fully we raised our shields and proceeded to step forward.

As the front lines drew closer, we would be caught off guard when the ghouls made giant leaps over our entire formation. We soon found ourselves boxed in as ghouls clawed us in the back while the remaining undead forces collided into us from the front. With little room to maneuver, shaloren archers and mages behind us were cut down, while soldiers in front could do little more than keep their shields in front of them to block attacks. Panicking, those who could teleport broke from the line, leaving the rest of us to fend off the encroaching undead horde. The situation was looking quite bleak as we found ourselves trapped by the undead and everything was thrown into complete disarray.]], [[[i]回顾一下亡灵的可怕本性，我能多少体会到他们所采用的战术和策略的精妙。一切似乎都是事先精心策划好的，作为不死族，他们能够以预定的方式完美地行动。这使得控制他们的死灵法师在战斗期间安全地远离伤害。[/i]

突然，我注意到队长的眼睛眯得很窄，紧紧地盯着烟雾中的东西，转过身来看着我自己，我注意到了那些颤动的扭曲。突然，随着守望队长大喊一声“开火”，许多弓箭手和法师开始发射弓箭并施法，随着弓箭和魔法的猛烈撞击，眼前的骚乱变成了旋转的漩涡。尽管遭到了猛烈的攻击，一排闪闪发光的骨头和破烂的盔甲还是穿过迷雾出现在了我们面前，露出几排排排成防御队形的骷髅。他们高举盾牌，一步一步地向墙走去。

卫兵们继续尽全力在城墙射击计，但每把一个骷髅打得粉碎或击碎成散落在战场上的骨头，后面就会出现两具骷髅。作为一个没有自由意志的敌人，无论他们中有多少人倒下，他们都继续向我们挺进。当它们走近城墙时，士兵们从下面开始把岩石和石头堆成一大堆，随着骷髅越来越近，士兵们开始把碎片从城墙上扔下来。与箭和咒语不同的是，骷髅无法克服掉在它们身上的沉重重量，许多骷髅接二连三被压个粉碎。

队长低头看着他们，似乎在沉思着形势，然后喃喃地说：“我看不到他们带着的攻城梯，但从他们如何走向城墙的角度来看，他们肯定有计划了。”我继续监视他们，注意到空气中沙哑的声音，附近突然传来惊慌失措的声音，墙上的人开始喊他们受到了袭击。环顾四周，我看不到任何袭击者，但我知道附近有敌人。然后我立刻感觉到有东西在我和守望队长身后移动。我迅速地拔出武器，在他们其中一人所在的地方向身后砍去，虽然我看不见敌人，但当我的武器从空中划过时，我听到一声低沉的喘息。

当意识到发生了什么事时，守望的上尉对城垛上的守军喊道：“我们正受到阴影的攻击，立即自卫！”一瞬间，城垛上的每个人都转向应对新的威胁，而忽略了下面的骷髅。那些能够确定隐藏的敌人在哪里的人，很快将他们的攻击集中在敌人身上，而那些无法进行大范围攻击的人则很难躲避。不久之后，一股死亡的呐喊声弥漫在空气中，但很快，我们就知道，这些敌人只是在分散我们的注意力。因为下面的骷髅开始移动，建造梯子，并形成由骨头组成的金字塔。

现在他们有了攻击我们的方法，骷髅爬起来，来到城垛上，用他们的优势人数击退了我们。看到我们被压得喘不过气来，守望队长下令放弃围墙，导致大家争先恐后，试图以任何可能的方式从城墙上下来。不幸的是，在混乱中，许多仍然在战斗或受伤的人无法逃脱，随后被砍成了碎片。在城垛失去控制后，一小队骷髅冲了进来，接管城门，让外面的其他不死生物进入，而其余的骷髅则开始跳下追赶我们，想把我们撞倒。

当我们沿着埃尔瓦拉的一条狭窄的街道奔跑时，守望队长看到了一个机会，命令法师们组成一条火线。穿过街道追击着我们的骷髅排成了一个紧密的队形，给我们提供了一个绝佳的机会，可以用一连串的咒语来对付他们。闪电、火焰和寒潮席卷战场，把它们的骨头散落在街上。看到大部分骷髅被击败，防守队员们爆发出一片欢呼，直到他们意识到还有更多的东西要来。透过倒下的骷髅，我们可以看到一股不死族的洪流正从城门涌出。

食尸鬼的喉音开始弥漫在空气中，与这些食尸鬼一起行走的还有几排骷髅。然而，正是在他们身后，一个真正可怕的不死族开始移动，那是和耸立在埃尔瓦拉的许多建筑物一样高的高耸的骨巨人。最后一排骷髅也出现了，但与其他骷髅不同的是，这些骷髅似乎配备了法杖和弓箭。很快，不死族开始组织自己，然后朝着我们的方向移动。我们的法师试图准备另一套法术，但很快发现我们很难对抗不死族的箭雨和法术的弹幕。意识到我们必须与不死族充分交战，我们举起盾牌，继续向前迈进。

随着前线越来越近，食尸鬼从我们的队伍上方跳过，让我们会措手不及。我们很快发现自己被包围了起来，食尸鬼在后面抓我们，而剩下的不死力量从前面撞向我们。我们后面的永恒精灵弓箭手和法师几乎没有任何回旋的余地，他们被砍倒了，而前面的士兵只能把盾牌放在前面阻挡攻击。惊慌失措之时，那些可以传送的人脱离了防线，留下我们其他人来抵御入侵的不死部落。我们发现自己被不死生物困住了，一切都乱成一团，情况看起来相当惨淡。]], "_t")

t([[[i]As an experienced commander would tell me long after the battle with the undead "the winner of a battle is not necessarily dictated by the amount of enemies slain but rather by which side breaks first." While the quality of an armies ability to fight is important it means nothing should its soldiers lose the will to fight. We had been lucky in the defense of Elvala with the aid from the ogres and eventually rallying leadership of Aranion.  Without them all hope of victory would have surely been lost.[/i]

The hatred within me began to build as enemies attacked from in front and behind. However, I had my own problems to deal with as one of the bone giants, as I would call them, stepped up to clobber me. Managing to somehow avoid the first attack I focused the chaotic energies within me and unleashed a powerful strike that destroyed a good portion of its lower body. This seemed to be to no avail though as the bone giant reorganizeed and shifted the bones of its body around to form a protective barrier before seemingly beginning to rebuild itself. The bone giant then proceeded to unleash another strike against me that left me stunned and temporarily unable to react. Put on my back foot, matters only got worse when a ghoul approached me from behind and bit deeply into my shoulder.

The situation was looking quite hopeless but from behind I heard a voice yell and out of the corner of my eye I saw a ghoul careen passed me. A flash of frost shot forth and blasted a hole through the ghoul as well as blowing off one of the arms of the bone giant in front of me. Glancing to the side I noticed a young ogre step up and I could hear the giant footsteps of stampeding ogres that were hurrying towards the fray. I didn't have much time to observe what was happening around me however as the bone giant turned its attention to me and the ogre. Attacking the first ogre, the much bigger bone giant brought down an attack with its other arm, knocking the ogre away like a rag doll.

Leaving itself open to my side I lunged to attack the bone giant once again, but this had little effect as I had little strength to cause any damage and the barrier of bones surrounding the bone giant's body absorbed the entirety of the blow. Responding to my efforts I was subsequently battered with another powerful attack and sent reeling away. Yet again though the ogre would come to my aid, charging into the bulk of the bone giant, and knocking it backwards away from me before it could make a follow up attack. Seeing me in my exhausted state, the ogre shouted over his shoulder for me to run, before activating a shielding run and bracing himself for the retaliation that would come. Battered and bruised I began to move away to recover.

After getting some distance away from the skirmish, I turned to survey the battlefield in its entirety. The undead line had been broken significantly by the charging ogres who had come to aid us, but a good deal of our defensive line was injured or dead. Many of those shaloren who had teleported away had now returned to fight, engaging in small groups on all sides of the undead army, and keeping the undead off balance. However, the line of skeleton archers and mages of the undead force remained largely intact, and were now picking off individual defenders in their unguarded flanks. The scene was one of chaos, and I could not tell if we were winning or losing, but nonetheless I could hear the screams of my fellow defenders dying all around me.

"It seems that this has turned into quite the battle,” a voice came out from behind me. All of a sudden as those words were being stated I could feel myself being enveloped in a bright glow, as my bruises disappeared and wounds began to heal. Turning to face the voice I came face to face with an armored shalore holding a glowing hand outstretched in my direction. I recognized the armor worn and weapon held as being the same set from the Grand Council Chambers. Putting his hand down the shalore continued, "I'm no doctor but this should be enough to keep you on your feet until the battle’s end. Now then, let's see..." He paused for a moment as he looked at the battlefield and then took a deep breath.

Then, in a rather surprisingly loud voice for a shalore he yelled, "DEFENDERS! FOCUS YOUR EFFORTS ON CRUSHING THE SKELETON ARCHERS AND MAGES, LEAVE THOSE HULKING BONE MONSTROSITIES AND ARMORED SKELETONS TO ME!" Before I even had a chance to understand what had been said, the shalore teleported himself in front of the ogre that had come to my aid and in an instant struck the side of the bone giant. All at once a violent display of colors exploded all around the bone giant that shattered the monstrosity into a thousand pieces all over the street. Not missing a beat, the shalore swiftly dove onto the next bone giant nearby and brought it down with little effort as well.

Seeing this display I immediately began to regain my will to fight, and following the order given I charged forward. However, before I could reach the undead ranged supporters a couple armored skeletons step forward with shields raised to meet me. Looking to break through them I stepped forward with a heavy strike only to have my attack deflected and my footing thrown off balance. Seeing an opportunity, one of the skeletons dropped its shield down and prepared to launch a counterattack against me. Before its attack could connect though, a heavy swipe flew over my head, sending its skull sailing away. From behind me another one of the ogres stepped forward and together we converged on the other skeleton.

After sending bones flying, I nodded to the ogre, and we continued on towards the waiting archers and mages. Along with the other ogres and shaloren we dove deep within the enemy ranks, hewing our weapons through their undefended line. Perhaps realizing that they had no hope of winning, the skeletons turned around and began to move away, seemingly entering into a retreat. Getting ready to pursue them, we were stopped by the remaining ghouls who jumped into our way, and the remaining bone giants that had not yet been dispatched. While the undead had been weakened enough to no longer be a threat, they would buy enough time for the skeleton archers and mages to escape out the gate and into the Shroud.]], [[[i]正如一位与不死生物战斗很久，经验丰富的指挥官之后告诉我的那样，“战斗的胜利者不一定取决于被杀敌人的数量，而是取决于哪一方坚持到最后。”虽然军队战斗能力的质量很重要，但这意味着士兵们不应失去战斗的意志。我们很幸运在食人魔的帮助，以及艾伦尼恩的领导之下保卫了埃尔瓦拉。没有他们，胜利的希望肯定会破灭。[/i]

当敌人从前面和后面进攻时，我内心的仇恨开始积聚。然而，我也有自己的问题要处理，那些高大的骨巨人踩过我的身边，试图碾碎我。我设法避免了第一次攻击，集中了我体内混乱的能量，并释放出一个强大的打击，摧毁了它的下半身的一大部分。不过，这似乎毫无用处，因为这个骨骼巨人形成了一个保护屏障，然后开始重组并移动了身体的骨骼，开始自我重建。骨巨人接着又对我发动了一次攻击，这让我目瞪口呆，暂时无法做出反应。在我的后面，一个食尸鬼从后面靠近我，深深地咬进我的肩膀，事情变得更糟了。

当时的情况看起来很绝望，但我从后面听到一个声音喊叫，眼角看到一个食尸鬼从我身边冲过。一道寒霜冲了出来，在食尸鬼身上炸了一个洞，还把我面前那个骨巨人的一只胳膊给炸飞了。我瞥了一眼侧面，注意到一个年轻的食人魔站了起来，我可以听到那些食人魔的巨大的脚步声，它们正朝着战场疾驰而去。我没有太多的时间去观察周围发生的事情，但是骨巨人把注意力从我身上转移到了食人魔的身上。那个大得多的骨巨人开始攻击，用另一只胳膊击倒了食人魔，像对待一个布娃娃一样把食人魔打飞。

我抓住这个机会，再次冲向骨巨人，但这几乎没有效果，因为我几乎没有力量造成任何伤害，骨巨人身体周围的骨头屏障吸收了整个打击。作为对我努力的回应，我随后又遭到了另一次强大的攻击，被重击打飞了出去。又一次，食人魔帮助了我，冲向这个骨巨人，在它能发动后续攻击之前把它从我身边推开。看到我精疲力尽的样子，食人魔在肩膀上喊着让我跑，然后启动了护盾，准备好迎接即将到来的报复。意识到自己受了重创，我开始离开去恢复。

在离那片战场有一段距离后，我转过身来，对整个战场进行了勘察。不死军队的阵线已经被前来帮助我们的冲锋食人魔严重破坏，但我们的防线有很多人受伤或死亡。许多被传送出去的永恒精灵现在回到战场上，在不死军团的四面八方进行小规模的战斗，让不死军团失去平衡。然而，骷髅弓箭手和有着不死之力的法师们的队伍基本上保持完整，现在他们正在无人看守的侧翼狙击我们的卫兵。现场一片混乱，我不知道我们是赢是输，但我仍然能听到我的队友们在我周围死去的尖叫声。

“看来这已经变成了一场真正的战争，”一个声音从我身后传来。当这些话被说出来的时候，我突然感觉到自己被一种明亮的光芒包围着，我的瘀伤消失了，伤口开始愈合。我面对面地转过身来，那是一个穿着盔甲的永恒精灵，举着一只发光的手，朝我的方向伸出。我认出他所穿的盔甲和手持武器，是我在大议会会议厅看到的同一套。永恒精灵放下手，继续说，“我不是医生，但这应该足以让你坚持战斗，直到战斗结束。现在，让我们看看……”他停了一会儿，看着战场，然后深吸了一口气。

然后，他用相当惊人的响亮的声音对永恒精灵喊道：“卫兵们！把你的精力集中在粉碎骷髅弓箭手和法师身上，把那些巨大的骨头怪物和装甲骷髅战士留给我吧！”在我还没来得及理解所说的话之前，永恒精灵就传送到了帮助我的食人魔面前，并在瞬间击中了骨巨人的侧面。突然，一股强烈的色彩在这个骨巨人周围爆炸了，把这个怪物的碎片炸得满街都是。那个永恒精灵抓住了机会，他迅速跳入附近的下一个骨巨人身上，也毫不费力地将它击倒。

看到这一幕，我立刻恢复了战斗的意志，按照命令向前冲去。然而，在我接触到不死族的远程部队之前，一对带盾牌的装甲骷髅走上前迎接我。为了突破他们，我向前迈了一大步，但是我的进攻偏斜了，双脚失去了平衡。看到机会，其中一具骷髅放下盾牌，准备对我发起反击。在它的攻击还没来得及集中我面前，一记重击从我的头顶飞过，把它的头骨划开了。从我身后，另一个食人魔走上前去，我们同时干掉了另一个骷髅。

在击飞了那具骨架之后，我向食人魔点了点头，继续向前方的弓箭手和法师那里杀去。我们与其他食人魔和永恒精灵一起深入敌阵，挥舞着武器切开它们未设防的战线。也许意识到他们没有获胜的希望，骷髅们转过身，开始离开，似乎准备开始撤退。我们准备追捕他们，却被跳进我们的路上的残存的食尸鬼和尚未被干掉的残存的骨巨人拦住了。尽管这些亡灵被削弱到不再是我们的威胁，他们为骷髅弓箭手和法师们赢得足够的时间逃离大门，进入帷幕之中。]], "_t")

t([[[i]I was oddly able to get back on my feet quite easily after receiving the initial healing spell cast on me, perhaps even quicker than what was normally possibly. This would hold true to the additional healing I would receive moments after. There is something about the chaotic energies within me that interacts with my body and allows it to mend quicker with the more hate I feel. This isn't something I can easily take advantage of however and should the hatred within me dissipate before I receive any medical attention it will result in a long and arduous recovery time.[/i]

It was at that point in the battle that I knew we had won. The bone giants that remained still proved to be quite a threat, but with enough overwhelming force we eventually got through their defenses and defeated them. As the last of the undead were felled the defenders began to break into another victory cheer. I was about to join them but I noticed the bright glow of another healing spell enveloping me once more. Turning around I noticed that the spell was being cast by one of the healers this time. "Get Fay healed as quickly as possibly doctor, I want her back in peak form as fast as possible." Hearing my name I wondered just who this shalore was as few in Elvala knew my name.

As the shalore took off his helmet I immediately would come to recognize Aranion Gawaeil's face. Speaking quickly to me he stated, "We will be exiting through the Shroud to see if we can catch whoever was responsible for this attack. Judging how the undead were acting, it is likely that whoever sent these attacks must be nearby." Registering his words I silently nodded to him, after which he proceeded to put back on his helmet and look out towards the direction of the Shroud. When the healer's healing spell was finished, Aranion directed the healer to get the wounded to the healing grounds, before holding out his hand in my direction. Readying myself I took a deep breath and took his hand.

In an instant Aranion cast a spell to teleport us to the other side of the Shroud. Taking a moment to get my bearings, it didn't take long for us to notice the retreating undead group, or the lone cloaked figure moving among them. I didn't have much time to glimpse at my surroundings before Aranion motioned me to follow. Keeping a good distance we shadowed the undead as we followed them to the northwest. For a couple of days we traveled just west of the Nargol borders, passing many destroyed settlements which showed signs of being recently attacked. I had guessed that the Nargols had attempted to reclaim these settlements, only for them to be attacked and their inhabitants turned into undead thralls, the same of which likely attacked Elvala.

After a time we slowly made our way into another settlement after the undead force, only to notice them stop therein. Nearing the edge of one of the buildings to catch a glimpse of what they were doing we spied the cloaked figure near a well. Out from one of the buildings a couple of skeletons emerged carrying some food on a plate. Whispering in a hushed voice Aranion quietly stated, "It appears, unlike the undead following him, our friend here is alive." As if on cue to Aranion's statement, a low raspy voice spoke from the cloaked figure saying, "Yes very much so alive." Dead silence permeated the air for a long moment after that, apart from the sound of food being eaten by the figure.

The entire time this was happening, the undead stood motionless. Sensing that the figured wished to talk, Aranion stepped out in full view, hand on his weapon but not yet drawn. Seeing Aranion come into view the figure stated, "Ahhhh, you were the one who was capable of crushing my creations in one blow, I must say I wasn't expecting someone to be capable of that, well done. Although your abilities in stealth are perhaps not as notable." At that moment Aranion drew his sword and stood at the ready with it stating, "I'd very much like to crush the creator as well." To this a raspy laugh escaped from the cloaked figure before a hand appeared and motioned towards Aranion to try.

Without hesitation Aranion immediately began charging forwards. Reacting to the sudden movement, the undead quickly moved to form a defensive line and block Aranion's approach. Consisting mostly of mages and archers at this point, they laid down a volley of projectiles and magic in Aranion's direction. In a mere instant Aranion teleported himself next to the cloaked figure, avoiding it all entirely. Reacting to this, the cloaked figure produced a sphere of protective magical energy to meet Aranion's attack. Tightly gripping his sword with both hands, Aranion raised it above his head and brought it down in a powerful swing. After that I am not sure as to what happened as a bright flash shot forward as the two powerful combatants clashed.

I'm not entirely sure of what had happened, but what I do know is that there was an explosion of energy that erupted between Aranion and the necromancer, creating a shock wave that ripped through the remnants of the settlement. Finding myself within one of the buildings I stumbled to my feet and attempted to reorient myself. When I was able to, I made my way out to the hole in the wall I had been thrown through to survey what had happened outside. Looking around all I could see was a scene of destruction as torn ground, ruined buildings, and charred air remained. Stepping out from the building my foot crushed one of many shattered bones that now lay strewn about the battlefield. This would unfortunately be noticed by several skeletons that had survived the blast.

When they raised their weapons in my general direction I knew I needed to act quickly. I approached a couple of the closer ones and deftly broke them into pieces with a couple well placed strikes. I was about to charge towards the rest but then I noticed a couple of the skeletons raising staves in my direction. Rapidly I dove behind the rubble of a nearby building and hid from the barrage of magic that lit up the space I had just been in. Getting to my feet and holding my weapon tightly I could hear them advancing towards my position. I readied myself and waited for the skeletons to come closer and watched for the moment when they would appear around the corner.]], [[[i]奇怪的是，当我接受了最初的治疗法术后，我能很容易地重新站起来，也许比正常情况下更快。对于那个时候我受到的其他治疗效果也是这样。看来，我体内的混乱能量在与我的身体相互作用，让它在我感觉到更多仇恨的情况下能够更快地修复。然而，这不是我可以轻易利用的东西，如果我内心的仇恨在我接受任何医疗治疗之前消散，我的康复过程将会变得漫长而艰巨。[/i]

就在那一刻，我知道我们赢了。留下来的骨巨人被证明是一个相当大的威胁，但我们最终以足够的压倒性力量击穿了他们的防御并击败了他们。当最后一个不死生物被击倒时，守军开始爆发出另一场胜利的欢呼。我正要加入他们，但我注意到另一个治疗咒语的明亮光芒再次笼罩着我。转过身来，我注意到这一次咒语是由其中一个治疗者施放的。“让菲尽快康复，医生，我希望她尽快恢复到巅峰状态”听到我的名字，我想知道这个永恒精灵是谁。在埃尔瓦拉，知道我的名字的人很少。

当永恒精灵摘下头盔时，我马上就认出了艾伦尼恩·加威尔的脸。他很快地对我说：“我们将通过帷幕离开，看看是否能抓住这次袭击的幕后黑手。观察不死生物的行为，很可能发动这些攻击的人一定就在附近。”我记下他的话，默默地向他点头，然后他继续戴上头盔，朝帷幕的方向望去。当治疗者的治疗咒语结束后，艾伦尼恩指示治疗者把伤员送到治疗场，然后向我的方向伸出手。我准备好了，深吸了一口气，握住他的手。

一瞬间，艾伦尼恩施了一个咒语，把我们传送帷幕的另一边。我们花了一点时间来辨认方位，没过多久就注意到了正在撤退的不死族，以及在他们中间移动的孤零零的长袍人影。我还没来得及花太多时间看一眼周围的环境，艾伦尼恩就示意我跟着他们走。我们与不死生物之间保持了一定的距离，跟着他们向西北方向走去。几天来，我们在纳格尔边界以西旅行，经过许多被摧毁的定居点，这些定居点显示出最近受到袭击的迹象。我猜纳格尔人曾试图夺回这些定居点，结果遭到攻击，他们的居民变成了不死军团的奴隶，这些不死奴隶可能就是袭击了埃尔瓦拉的那一批。

过了一段时间，我们慢慢跟在不死军团后面进入另一个营地，却发现他们停在那里。当我们靠近一座建筑物的边缘，设法观察他们在做些什么的时候，我们在一口井附近发现了这个穿着长袍的人。从其中一栋楼里出来了几具骷髅，盘子里放着一些食物。艾伦尼恩用一种安静的声音低声说：“看来，不像跟在他后面的不死生物，我们的这位朋友还活着。”仿佛是听了艾伦尼恩的话，一种低沉的刺耳的声音从这个披着斗篷的人嘴里说出：“是的，非常的活着。”之后很长一段时间，除了食物被吃掉的声音，空气中弥漫着死寂。

在这整个过程中，不死生物一动不动地站着。艾伦尼恩觉得那个人想说话，就全神贯注地走了出来，手里拿着武器，但还没拔出来。看到艾伦尼恩出现在自己的视线中，他说：“啊，你是那个能够一下子粉碎我的创造物的人，我必须说，我没想到有人能做到这一点，干得好。虽然你的潜行能力也许没有那么显著。”艾伦尼恩拔出剑，站在那里说，“我也很想粉碎它们的创造者。”穿着长袍的人发出一声刺耳的嗤笑，伸出一只手，示意艾伦尼恩去尝试。

艾伦尼恩毫不犹豫地立即开始向前冲锋。不死族迅速移动，对这突如其来的移动做出反应，形成了一道防线，阻挡了艾伦尼恩的接近。他们主要由法师和弓箭手组成，在艾伦尼恩的方向上发射了大量的箭矢和魔法。在短短的一瞬间，艾伦尼恩将自己传送到了长袍人旁边，完全避开了这一切。对此，长袍人产生了一个保护性的魔法能量球来对付艾伦尼恩的攻击。艾伦尼恩双手紧握剑，将剑举过头顶，有力地挥舞着。当两个强大的战士碰撞时，一道明亮的闪光向前射出，在那之后，我不知道发生了什么。

我不完全确定发生了什么，但我知道的是，在艾伦尼恩和死灵法师之间爆发了能量爆炸，产生了冲击波，撕裂了定居点的残余。我发现自己摔倒在一栋楼里，跌跌撞撞地站了起来，试图重新调整自己的方向。当我重新站起来的时候，我走出了那个被我砸穿的墙洞，想要调查外面发生了什么。环顾四周，我看到的是一片废墟，残破的土地，残破的建筑物，空气中仍然弥漫着烧焦的气息。从大楼里走出，我的脚碾碎了一块散落在战场上的碎骨头。不幸的是，在爆炸中幸存下来的几具骷髅注意到了这一点。

当他们向我的方向举起武器时，我知道，必须迅速采取行动。我走近两个离我比较近的骷髅，灵巧地击中了他们的要害，将他们击碎。我正要冲向其他地方，但我注意到有几具骷髅朝我的方向举起了法杖。我迅速地躲在附近一座建筑的瓦砾后面，躲开了命中我刚才所处地方的魔法。我站起身来，紧紧握住武器，听到他们朝我的位置走去。我做好了准备，等待骷髅走近，并观察它们何时会出现在拐角处。]], "_t")

Unfortunately not as mindless as I thought they would be, the skeletons were smart enough to keep their distance as they rounded the corner. Cursing, I began to run as fast as I could in an attempt to close the gap as fast as possible as the skeletons sent forth a volley of spells. My anger exploding at this point I felt a chaotic rush of energy fill me and in the next moment I was cleaving my weapon through the body of one of the mages from the side. Not missing a beat at my movement, the other skeleton promptly turned to face the new direction and unleashed a searing ray of arcane energies that clipped through my shoulder. I was about to converge on the other skeleton, but an arrow would then pierce through my foot and pin me to the ground.

Realizing I needed to end this quickly, I raised my arm and immediately discharged my heat beam rune into the other mage, before rushing after the archer that had loosed the arrow. Seeing my advance it released another arrow in my direction which I sidestepped out of the way of with ease. In the next moment I was on top of the archer, senselessly battering it into submission with a relentlessly torrent of blows. When the archer was dealt with I turned once more to look in the direction of the skeleton mage. Merely walking over to it I simply cast my arm out and knocked its skull from its skeletal frame before it had a chance to cast another spell.

I panted heavily for the next few moments as the hatred within me slowly began to subside once again. As I slowly caught my breath then heard the distinct sound of applause and looking for the source of I spied the cloaked figure of the necromancer nearby. As the clapping finished, the necromancer began to speak, "Well done, well done." Checking my surroundings I could not see Aranion around in our vicinity, making me wonder what had happened to him. Deciding to inquire as to Aranion whereabouts I asked, "Where's Aranion." To this I got the response "Oh? As in Aranion Gawaeil? Well, the general is occupied, at least for the moment. Likely he'll be back soon but for now I think I'll entertain myself with you."

A cold feeling immediately took hold of me as the necromancer finished its sentence and abruptly began to wheeze and chuckle. As I approached with my weapon drawn and ready to swing my weapon the necromancer reached within its cloak and teleported away to a pile of shattered bones. I froze in place as a dark sensation as the necromancer pulled something out, something that I knew held great power, great and terrible. Attempting to discern the object, I was able to make out a short thin staff, but not one that looked to be made of any material I had seen a staff made of before. Perhaps sensing my awareness of the staff the necromancer spoke again, "Oh? You don't seem to be a mage yet you can feel this dark power can't you?"

"Bones are so interesting you know, they can tell you a lot about a person. You can learn their owner's identity, where and when they lived, how old they were when they died, the injuries and hardships they had suffered in their lives, and so forth. Quite fascinating really, of course studying them is quite frowned upon, quite bothersome really." The necromancer began to cough and wheeze a few time before continuing. "Some of the most peculiar bones I've come across can be found within my staff, and when I find some peculiar bones I would like to add to my staff..." The sentence trailed off and the necromancer started to chuckle. A chill then went down my spine as I could feel the dark intentions of the necromancer focusing on me.

I watched the necromancer make quick motion of the staff towards the bone pile causing all the bones within the pile to begin to organize themselves into a mass of towering bones. Limbs of all manner of terror and death began to form as a new bone giant was created. The necromancer let loose a raspy joyous cackle before indicating to the bone giant with a motion of the staff that I was an enemy to be clobbered. Responding to the command the bone giant started moving in my direction. Looking to inflict the first blow I unleashed as powerful an attack as I could against the abomination, I charged forward and attacked one of its legs, hoping to knock it off balance and gain a quick advantage over it.

Much like before in Elvala however, this bone giant too would shift its bones around to reinforce the damage I inflicted on it, managing to negate the efforts of my attack. In the next moment I could do nothing as it suddenly shot forth one of its limbs and caught me in the arm. The spikes and razor sharp joints tore through the armor covering my shoulder causing great pain. In an attempt to return a blow I pushed forward again, but due to the pain from my received injury I was prevented from mustering all the physical force that I could. Hatred began to boil within me as I was knocked around by heavy blows before finally I unleashed my chaotic energies into the bone giant in an attempt to stunt its movements.

The bone giant quickly began to falter and become clumsy, my chaotic energies interfering with its ability to move. Trying to attack me while under the pressure of my hatred its attacks became slow and readable and I was able to dodge them. Now on the offensive I slashed heavily against the creature all over its body in an attempt to overwhelm it. Once again a barrier of bones formed to defend it, but not the least bit discouraged I relentlessly continued my attack, eventually breaking through. Unable to withstand my continual ferocity its bones flew in all directions as I tore through it from front to back. Now standing facing the necromancer, I could hear the bone giant behind me collapse back into a pile of bones once more.]], [[[i]战斗准则第一条，随时准备好逃跑计划，以防遇到麻烦。战斗准则第二条，当逃无可逃的时候准备作战。战斗准则第三条，不要把处在一个会被多个方向侧翼包围的位置。战斗准则第四条，不要在战斗结束前精疲力尽。战斗准则第五条，不要死。[/i]

不幸的是，这些骷髅不像我想象的那样愚蠢，它们聪明到可以在转弯时保持距离。我咒骂着，开始以最快的速度奔跑，试图以最快的速度缩小差距，因为骷髅正对我发出一连串的咒语。这一刻，我的愤怒爆发了，一股混乱的能量涌向我的全身，在接下来的一刻，我的武器侧面劈开了一个法师的身体。另一具骷髅没有错过机会，迅速地转向新的方向，释放出一道灼热的奥术能量射线，穿过我的肩膀。我正准备在干掉另一具骷髅，但一支箭刺穿我的脚，把我钉在地上。

意识到我需要尽快结束这一切，我举起我的手臂，立即将我的热能射线符文释放到另一个法师身上，然后冲向已经射出箭的弓箭手。看到我的前进，它又朝我的方向射出一支箭，我轻松地避开了。下一刻，我站在弓箭手的面前，用力地猛击弓箭手，用无情的猛击击倒了它。当弓箭手被干掉后，我再次转向骷髅法师的方向。我轻松走到它跟前，伸出胳膊，在它有机会施展另一个咒语之前，把它的头骨从骨架上敲了下来。

在接下来的几分钟里，我喘着粗气，因为我内心的仇恨又开始慢慢平息。我慢慢地屏住呼吸，然后听到明显的掌声，寻找来源，我发现了附近穿着长袍的死灵法师。拍手声结束后，死灵法师开始说：“干得好，干得好。”我观察着周围的环境，发现在附近看不到艾伦尼恩，不知道他到底怎么了。我决定询问艾伦尼恩的下落，问道：“艾伦尼恩在哪儿。”对此，我得到的回答是“哦？你说艾伦尼恩·加威尔？嗯，将军现在不在，至少目前是这样。他很可能很快就会回来，但现在我想现在和你好好玩玩。”

死灵法师说完这句话，突然开始喘息和咯咯笑，一种冰冷的感觉立刻抓住了我。我拿着武器走近，准备挥舞我的武器，死灵法师突然从斗篷中伸出手，传送到一堆粉碎的骨头上。当我看见死灵法师拿出一样东西的时候，我感受到了一种黑暗的力量而愣住了。我知道那样东西拥有巨大的力量，巨大而可怕。我试着辨认出那东西，看到那是一根又短又细的法杖，但却不像是用我以前见过的法杖做的材料做的。也许是感觉到我的表情，死灵法师又对我说：“哦？你好像不是法师，但你能感觉到这种黑暗力量，不是吗？”

“骨头很有趣，你知道，它们能告诉你很多关于一个人的事情。你可以了解他们的主人的身份，他们住的地方和时间，他们去世时的年龄，他们在生活中遭受的伤害和苦难，等等。真的很迷人，当然，研究它们是很麻烦的，真的很烦人。”死灵法师开始咳嗽和喘息了几次，然后继续。“我碰到的一些最奇特的骨头，都被我装在了我的法杖里。而当我找到更多奇特的骨头时，我想，我会给我的法杖加上……”这句话渐渐地消失了，死灵法师开始咯咯地笑起来。然后我感到一阵寒意，我能感觉到死灵法师盯着我的黑暗意图。

死灵法师快速地将法杖指向骨头堆，使骨头堆中的所有骨头开始组织成一个高耸的怪物。随着各种恐怖和死亡的四肢开始形成，一个新的骨巨人诞生了。死灵法师发出一阵刺耳的欢笑，然后用法杖的指向向骨巨人表明我是一个应当被击倒的敌人。响应命令，骨巨人开始朝我的方向移动。我想先下手为强，对那可憎之物发起强有力的攻击，于是我向前冲去，攻击了它的一条腿，希望能使它失去平衡，并迅速战胜它。

不过，就像以前在埃尔瓦拉一样，在我攻击她的时候，这个骨巨人也会移动它的骨骼来强化自己，设法抵消我攻击的伤害。在接下来的一瞬间，它突然伸出一只手，刺穿了我的胳膊。而我什么也做不了，因为尖刺和锋利的关节撕裂了我肩膀上的盔甲，造成了巨大的疼痛。为了还击，我又向前推了一把，但由于受伤的疼痛，我无法集中全力。当我被沉重的打击击倒的时候，仇恨开始在我心中沸腾，最后我把我混乱的能量释放到这个骨巨人身上，试图阻止它的动作。

骨巨人很快开始动摇，变得笨拙，我混乱的能量干扰了它的移动能力。骨巨人在我仇恨的压力下试图攻击我，但它的攻击变得缓慢，我成功的躲开了它们。看到自己处于攻势，我猛砍这个生物，试图压倒它。它再一次形成了一道骨头屏障来保护它，但我丝毫没有气馁，坚持不懈地继续进攻，最终击碎了它。它无法忍受我连续不断的凶猛打击，直到我从前到后撕开它，它的骨头向四面八方飞去。现在，我站在死灵法师面前，听到身后的骨巨人又一次倒下成一堆骨头。]], "_t")

t([[[i]There is truly no other way to describe the necromancer that I met but completely evil. One might consider the magic hating fanatics I had written about in my earlier books as evil, but even from them I could sense that they were attempting to bring about a better world, despite how twisted their actions might have been. This fiend of undeath though, I could sense no goodwill from, and the actions undertaken seemed to be only for the purpose of personal amusement. Judging from emotions that I could feel from the magic as well, I don't think that necromancy could ever be used by anyone other than those of an evil nature.[/i]

As I felled the bone giant I could hear the necromancer clapping once more. "Very good, well done, quite the display. Your bones will truly be worth adding to my staff,” the necromancer stated in sinister tone. Turning my head towards necromancer I stated boldly, "It will take more than your mere bone giant to kill me." Seemingly caught in thought to my statement the necromancer replied, "Hmmm, bone giant, quite the name. Yes, I think that will do nicely as a name. Of course, you seem to be misunderstanding something. The bone giant, as you call it, is not quite dead yet." Registering the words, I didn't have much time to react before I could feel a hard blow swat me from the side.

Snapping my eyes to what had hit me, I immediately realized that the bone giant was indeed not defeated as it stepped forward to stand in between me and the necromancer. What's more, it had seemed that it had reassembled itself into a new fiendish form that was ready to do battle. As the bone giant approached to attack me I could hear the voice of the necromancer in the background as are battle began to start again. "These Bone Giants as you call them are quite something aren't they. I got inspiration for them from the Nargols when they fought against the Conclave in the Allure Wars. You see, few know this but the Nargols actually used necromancy to ultimately win their fight against the Conclave."

I could hear the necromancer wheeze and cackle in the background for a moment, but I was more concerned with the bone giant attacking me. Somewhat exhausted from beating it down the first time I lacked the strength to overcome its defenses a second time and bring it down again. I slowly proceeded to back away in order to buy some time and examine my options in regards to what I might be able to do to defeat it. The swirling barrier of bones were already circling its body, and I knew that I wouldn't be able to do any lasting damage against it as a result. Sooner or later I would have to commit to fighting it fully, and I knew that I would want to make that commitment on my own terms.

Distressingly however, finding an opportunity was made more difficult as the necromancer continued to prattle on. "These bone giants as you call them, they can be formed in a variety of ways to kill and as you can see they are quite durable. I'm actually quite thankful that you managed to rip through it as you did just now, I can already see ways in which I can improve my next one." Concluding the sentence the necromancer began to laugh and wheeze once more. It was quite infuriating, and I'm not even sure why I remember the necromancer's words so vividly. However, I would not be bested by the bone giant and I decided that I would try to make a final stand and bring it down again.

I rushed into the bone giant, taking a quick swipe that knocked a few bones away. Noticing that the bone barrier didn't absorb the blow I quickly realized that it had since dissipated. Sensing that I only had a brief moment before it would come back, I fully committed to unleashing as much power as I could within the next strike. Hitting with all the strength I could muster I quickly knocked away a good chunk of the bone giant’s mid section, causing it to stumble a bit. Once again like before it attempted to shift its bones around in order to maintain itself, but my attacks were chipping bones away bit by bit. However, the bone giant would not allow itself to be defeated so easily.

With a quick motion the bone giant shot forth one of its limbs against me, once again ripping against my flesh with painful spikes. Not discouraged by this in the slightest however, I let loose my heat beam rune and ignited its bones, and more importantly I relieved the pain from the blow. As I resumed my attacks I could hear the raspy voice in the background seemingly comment, "Hmm, runes... ohhh! I know, I'll graft some runes onto the next one! What interesting ideas you are giving me." Still focused on my fight, I continued to strike it again and again until finally the bone giant fell apart. Not sure if it would get up again I continued to hack at it until I had completely disassembled it.

Forgetting about the necromancer though, I immediately felt my body go numb, and quickly noticed ice forming all around my body. Immobilized, I darted my eyes around before spying the necromancer with an outstretched hand. Slowly the necromancer approached me, coming around to my left arm where my heat beam rune was inscribed. Putting its hand under what I assumed to be its chin, the necromancer noted, "Not once but twice you have defeated my bone giant. I suspected you might be able to bring it down once, but bringing it down again right after was quite unexpected. Now, I really have to wonder who you are? You appear to be a thalore to me, but what were you doing in Elvala? Hmmm."

Continuing around me to stand in front before circling around to my right, necromancer continued to make "hmm, hmm" sounds. Proceeding to stop the necromancer began to muse aloud once more, "Quite surprising seeing you use runes. Are you a criminal exiled from the forests perhaps? Wait, what's this second rune you have inscribed?" While I couldn't see the necromancer I could feel the intent staring at the Rune of Return that had been inscribed on the back of my neck. From behind a remark rang out, "Ahh, interesting. A shaloren design but judging from the markings it appears an ogre's handiwork was involved in inscribing this rune if I am not mistaken. Quite intriguing."

The necromancer continued to talk aloud for several moments as he circled around me again and again, which was fine by me. I could feel the arcane energy replenishing within my heat beam rune, and when I had the chance I would activate it and release myself from my icy imprisonment. Perhaps aware of my intent though the necromancer quickly glanced at my eyes before stating, "You are quite an oddity aren't you? However, you aren't much the conversationalist so there is little reason for me to keep you alive. I can easily study your corpse instead of leaving you alive you see." I could sense the magic beginning to accumulate in one of the necromancer's hands as he concluded by saying, "Farewell thalore." ]], [[[i]我遇到的死灵法师，除了完全邪恶之外，实在没有别的办法来形容。有人可能会认为我在早前的书中写的那些讨厌魔法的狂热分子是邪恶的，但即使是从他们身上，我也能感觉到他们试图带来一个更美好的世界，尽管他们的行为可能是过于扭曲的。不过，在这个不死之魔那里，我感觉不到任何善意，他所采取的行动似乎只是为了个人娱乐。从我能从魔法中感受到的情绪来看，我认为死灵法术只会被完全邪恶之人使用。[/i]

当我击倒这个骨巨人时，我又听到了死灵法师的鼓掌声。”很好，做得很好，挺好看的。“你的骨头真的值得加在我的杖上，”死灵法师用阴险的语气说。我把头转向死灵法师，大胆地说：“要杀死我，你的骨巨人还远远不够。”死灵法师似乎陷入了对我的陈述的思考中，回答道：“嗯，骨巨人，这个名字很不错。是的，我想这个名字很不错。当然，你好像误解了什么。你所说的骨巨人还没完全死，”听到这些话，我还没来得及反应，就感觉到一记重击从侧面打中了我。

我猛地一眨眼睛，立刻意识到这个骨巨人并没有被打败，它走上前来站在我和死灵法师之间。更重要的是，它似乎已经重新组合成一个新的恐怖形态，准备好战斗。战斗又开始了，当骨巨人接近攻击我时，我可以听到背景中死灵法师的声音：“你所说的这些骨巨人是很了不起的，不是吗。我从纳格尔人那里得到灵感，这是他们在厄流战争中对抗孔克雷夫时使用的武器。你看，很少有人知道这一点，但纳格尔人实际上利用死灵法术最终赢得了与孔克雷夫的战斗。”

我能听到死灵法师在背景中喘息和咯咯地笑了一会儿，但我更担心的是攻击我的骨巨人。第一次击倒它让我有些疲惫不堪，我没有力量再次战胜它的防御，并再次击倒它。我慢慢地往后退，以便争取一些时间，并思考我还可以选择什么来击败它。骨头的漩涡屏障在它的身体里盘旋，因此，我知道现在没法对它造成任何持久的伤害。迟早，我会找到一个机会发动一次全力打击，而我正在积极寻找这一机会。

然而，令人沮丧的是，寻找机会十分困难，而死灵法师仍然在继续喋喋不休：“你所说的这些骨巨人，它们可以组合成多种形态，来进行各式各样的杀戮。你可以看到它们非常耐用。我真的很感激，看到你刚才那样把它撕开的方式，我已经想到了改进下一个的方法。”在结束这句话后，死灵法师又开始大笑和喘息。这真是太让人恼火了，我甚至不知道为什么我能如此生动地记住死灵法师的话。然而，我不会被骨巨人打败，我决定我会努力背水一战，并再次把它打倒。

我冲进了骨巨人，快速地进行斩击，把几根骨头都打掉了。注意到骨盾没有吸收我的攻击，我很快意识到它已经消散了。我意识到，我只有很短的时间，骨盾很快又会重新出现，我必须在下一次攻击中释放尽可能多的力量。我使出全力的打击，很快就把巨人中段的一大块骨头打掉，导致它绊倒了。它再次像以前一样试图移动它的骨头，以维持自己，但我的攻击一点一点地削掉骨头。然而，骨巨人不会让自己这么容易被打败。

骨巨人迅速地向我伸出一只骨爪，用痛苦的尖刺再一次撕开我的肉。然而，我丝毫没有因此而气馁，启动了热能射线符文，点燃了它的骨头，更重要的是，这减轻了它的打击带来的痛苦。我继续攻击时，能听到死灵法师刺耳的声音，似乎在评论着我，“嗯，符文……哦！我知道，我会把一些符文装在下一个骨巨人身上！你给了我这么多有趣的想法。”但我仍然专注于我的战斗，一次又一次地打击它，直到最后看到骨巨人崩溃。我不确定它是否会再次复活，于是继续攻击它，直到我完全将其打成粉碎。

不过，我忘记了死灵法师的存在。一瞬间，我突然感觉到身体麻木了，很快就注意到自己的身体周围结冰了。我一动不动地四处张望，发现了对着我伸出一只手的死灵法师。死灵法师慢慢地靠近我，走向我的左臂，在那里刻着我的热束符文。死灵法师把手放在我认为是它下巴的地方，说道：“你打败了我的骨巨人，不是一次而是两次。我以前以为你也许能干掉它一次，但能够干掉两次真的是出乎我的医疗。现在，我真的想知道你是谁？在我看来，你是一个自然精灵，但你在埃尔瓦拉做什么？嗯……”

死灵法师从我的前面，慢慢绕到我的右边，继续发出“嗯，嗯”的声音。终于，死灵法师停了下来，又一次说道：“很惊讶看到你能使用符文。你是不是被放逐到森林里的罪犯？等等，你刻的第二个符文是什么？”尽管我看不见死灵法师，我能感觉到它凝视着刻在我脖子后面的返回符文。一句话从后面响起，“啊，有趣。一个永恒精灵的设计，但从标记来看，如果我没有记错的话，铭刻这个符文似乎是食人魔的工艺。很有趣。”

死灵法师在我周围一圈又一圈地转来转去，他继续大声地说了几句话，这对我来说是一个好机会。我能感觉到我的热能射线符文重新聚集着奥术能量，只要再等一会儿，我就可以重新激活它，把自己从冰冷的监牢中释放出来。或许感受到了我的意图，死灵法师很快瞥了我一眼，然后说：“你真是个怪人，不是吗？不过，你不太健谈，所以我没什么理由让你活着。我可以很容易地研究你的尸体，而不需要让你活着，”我可以感觉到死灵法师的一只手开始积聚魔法，他最后说，“永别了，自然精灵。”]], "_t")

t([[[i]Something that I have always wondered about is why people give names to inanimate objects. Aranion would lose hold of his weapon at some point during the fight with the Necromancer, though I'm not specifically sure at what time in the fight this would be. Even now as I write this, Aranion frets over his lost sword as if he had lost a loved one. While I can understand how one can get accustomed to a weapon, surely he can find another to use instead?[/i]

Sensing that I needed to act now, I activated the heat beam rune, melting the ice around and me and sending a surging blast of fire towards the necromancer. As the necromancer stumbled back in flames as I took the moment to heave my weapon forward with all the force I could muster, only to pierce through nothing as the necromancer disappeared. Before I had a chance to see where the necromancer had teleported to, a burst of hot flames enveloped me from behind. Turning around I could see the necromancer, singed yet no longer on fire. I had been read completely and now I danced around in searing pain as every inch of my body burned. The necromancer cackled as I noticed the heat beam rune inscribed on the bottom of his outstretched arm.

Annoyed at how easily I had been handled, I gritted my teeth and charged forward at the necromancer, only to be stopped by several undead blocking my way. Cackling some more, I felt a sharp pain cut through me as the necromancer released a dark beam of energy that shot through the skeletons and me. As I cringed in pain and had little time to react before the necromancer's minions began to attack me from all sides. Infuriated, I began to strike at everything surrounding me, tearing a path through the undead up to the necromancer. Coming face to face with the fiend I was about to deliver a great blow, but with a simple wave at me I felt a heavy force slam into my chest.

Darkness seemed to pierce my mind and try as I might I could not resist it. I was sent careening backwards where I slammed into a wall. My vision began to blur as I lay on the ground. Despite this however I could still hear the necromancer cackle before the yammering began again. "How pathetic, really you are. Fighting is more than just hitting things with overwhelming force! You are truly powerful thalore, but power in and of itself is meaningless. Your moves are too telegraphed, your attacks are easily countered, and you don't seem to have the slightest idea of how to strategize in combat. Oh well. Perhaps after I kill you I'll just raise your corpse as it is and show you how to properly engage yourself in a fight."

Despite my inability to remember things said to me, I remember those words quite well as they rang through my head. Poetically I could say that they pierced me more than any wound inflicted on me that day, but that would fail to describe just how many spellblasts and cursed spells would be sent into my body. For every action I would make the necromancer would be two steps ahead and for every mistake I would make I would pay dearly. As the battle went on I could feel my body beginning to grow colder and I knew that despite how tough I was I could not continue to sustain my fighting efforts for much longer. My desperation was perhaps just as noticeable as anything else by the necromancer.

Then at last my body could stand no more and I collapsed to the ground unable to move. Waves of cold and dark energy circulated within my body and I realized just how close to the limits of my own mortality I was. I remember as my thoughts turned over to past events of my life in that moment, to a time before the Spellblaze when I lived in the forests with my fellow thaloren, a simpler and more peaceful time to be sure. I didn't want to die, nor suffer whatever mad plans this necromancer would have for me either. Yet I could do nothing more now as the necromancer slowly approached to stand over me and say, "Such a fruitless effort thalore. Perhaps with time you would have become a notable hero of legend. But now you die."

In the next moment I could not describe to you the amount of pain that ripped through my body as the necromancer unleashed a deathly magic that tortured every fibre of my being. As I was engulfed in agony my mind slowly began to black out and I slowly edged closer and closer to death. I might have been killed had Aranion not managed to return just in time to interrupt the necromancer and cancel the spell cast on me. I don't know the specifics of what happened next after that, only that Aranion was somehow able to extract me and himself from the grasp of the necromancer and escape. Somehow I endured long enough after that for Aranion to cast a basic healing spell on me, enough to keep me alive until we returned to Elvala.

I briefly remember when I was initially recovering that I opened my eyes while laying in one of the medical beds back in Elvala. In a chair near me I saw my husband sleeping, waiting for me. I tried to call out but instead I let out a scream. My husband would call for a healer as my body was wracked in pain from the many injuries I had endured for so long. I would sleep for a long time after that, for how long I do not know, but the next time I woke up I would be in my own room within my house. Looking around once again I could see that it was nighttime, and my husband again sat sleeping in a chair, still waiting for me. For how long he waited I do not know.

Once more I called out saying his name "Awain". As he roused from his sleep and looked at me an endless amount of tears would begin streaming down his face. In a cracked voice I heard him say, "You're awake, you're still alive." He hurried over to me, putting his hands under me to embrace me tightly, and began sobbing uncontrollably. For the moment I allowed him to cry, feeling that I should hold back on inquiring as to how I had made it back to Elvala. I didn't know how long I had been unconscious but I had the feeling that he had waited the entire time for me, waiting for the moment I would come back to him. I embraced him back and sobbed too as we were reunited once more.]], [[[i]我一直想知道的是，为什么人们要给无生命的物体起名字。在与死灵法师的战斗中，艾伦尼恩失去了他的武器，尽管我不确定这场战斗的具体时间是什么。就在我写这篇文章的时候，艾伦尼恩还在为他丢失的剑烦恼，好像他失去了一个心爱的人。虽然我能理解一个会对一件武器抱有感情，但我想，他肯定能找到另一件来代替吧？[/i]

感觉到我现在必须行动了，我启动了热能射线束符文，融化环绕着我的冰块，并向死灵法师发射了一股猛烈的火焰。当看到死灵法师在火焰中挣扎时，我抓住机会尽我所能地举起武器向前，结果穿过了一片空气，死灵法师突然消失了。在我还没来得及看到死灵法师传送到哪里之前，一股炽热的火焰从后面包围了我。转过身来，我看到了那个死灵法师，他丝毫没有被烧着。我的一切举动都被他预测到了，现在我的身体每一寸都在燃烧，在灼热的疼痛中挣扎。死灵法师咯咯地笑着，我注意到他伸出的手臂底部刻着热能射线符文。

我很恼火于被他算计，咬紧牙关朝死灵法师冲去，结果被几个不死生物拦住了。死灵法师又咯咯地笑了几声，释放出一道穿透我和骷髅的黑暗能量束，我感到一阵剧痛划破了我的全身。当我在痛苦中畏缩，几乎没有时间做出反应时，死灵法师的仆从们开始从四面八方攻击我。我怒不可遏，开始攻击周围的一切，从不死族中杀出一条血路，一直杀到死灵法师跟前。我面对着那个邪恶的死灵法师，准备给他一击重击，但他只是简单地挥了挥手，我就感觉到一股巨大的力量猛击我的胸膛。

黑暗似乎刺穿了我的心灵，我无法抗拒。我被向后撞去，撞在墙上。我倒在地上，视野开始模糊。尽管如此，我仍然能听到死灵法师咯咯的笑声，然后开始用那样的语气发出了说教：“你真可怜。战斗不仅仅是用压倒性的力量打击敌人！你确实是一个强大的自然精灵，但力量本身是没有意义的。你的动作太夸张了，你的攻击很容易被反击，你似乎一点也不知道如何在战斗中制定战略。哦，好吧。也许在我杀了你之后，我会复活你的尸体，教你如何正确地投入战斗。”

尽管我经常记不住人们对我说的话，但当这些话在我脑海中回响时，我记得很清楚。从某种意义上，我可以说这些话比那天给我造成的任何伤害都更刺痛我，但这并没法描述那一天有多少法术和诅咒轰击了我的身体。我每做一件事，死灵法师都会领先两步，每犯一个错误，我都会付出高昂的代价。随着战斗的进行，我能感觉到我的身体开始变冷，我知道，尽管我的意志已经足够坚强，但我也无法继续在战斗中坚持下去。我的绝望和死灵法师所看到的一样明显。

最后，我的身体再也站不住了，瘫倒在地上无法动弹。寒冷和黑暗的能量波在我的体内循环，我意识到，自己是多么接近死亡的边缘。我记得在那一刻，我的思绪转回到我生命中的往事，回到我和我的自然精灵同胞一起生活在森林里的那一刻，那是一个更简单、更平静的时刻。我不想死，也不想忍受这个死灵法师对我的疯狂计划。但是现在我什么也做不了了，死灵法师慢慢地走近我，站在我面前说：“你的努力都是徒劳。也许随着时间的推移，你会成为一个著名的传奇英雄。但现在，你已经死了。”

我无法向你描述，在接下来的一刻，当死灵法师释放出一种折磨我身体每一根纤维的死亡魔法时，我全身所受的痛苦。当我沉浸在痛苦中时，我的大脑也慢慢地开始昏厥，慢慢地越来越接近死亡。如果艾伦尼恩没有及时回来，打断死灵法师对我的施法的话，我可能已经被杀死了。我不知道接下来发生了什么事情的细节，只知道艾伦尼恩不知何故从死灵法师的魔爪中解救出了我和他自己。不知怎的，在那之后，我忍受了足够长的时间，艾伦尼恩给我施了一个基本的治疗咒语，足以让我活着，直到我们回到埃尔瓦拉。

我只能模糊的记得，当我终于恢复之后，我躺在埃尔瓦拉的一张病床上睁开了眼睛。在旁边的椅子上，我看见我的丈夫在睡觉，他在等着我。我试着说话，但却只能发出一声尖叫。我丈夫叫人来医治我，因为我受了太多的伤，身体各处都疼得要命。之后，我睡了很长一段时间，不知道睡了多久，但下次醒来时，我发现在家中自己的房间里。再次环顾四周，我发现那是晚上了，我丈夫又坐在椅子上睡着了，他还在等着我。我不知道他等了多久。

我再一次喊出他的名字：“艾尔温”。当他从睡梦中醒来看着我时，他的脸上流下了无尽的泪水。我听见他用嘶哑的声音说：“你醒了，你还活着。”他急忙走到我跟前，用手抱起我，紧紧和我相拥，开始不可控制地抽泣起来。就在那一刻，我和他一起哭了起来，觉得我不该再去打听我是怎么回到埃尔瓦拉，回到他身边的。我不知道自己昏迷了多久，但我能感觉到他一直在等我，等我回到他身边的那一刻。当我们再次团聚的时候，我也拥抱着他哭泣着。]], "_t")

t([[Eventually when I got the story from my husband, I found out what had happened after the battle in detail. The necromancer had apparently fled or perhaps had allowed for Aranion to retreat with me back to Elvala. I was very close to death, but the healers worked tirelessly to stabilize my condition, although having difficulties doing so due to my Spellblaze Affliction and terrible injuries that had been wrought on my body by the necromancer's spells. For many days I remained within the medical facilities, as the healers worked to save my life, before eventually being relocated to my own home under the care of my husband.

At this point a sombre expression took hold of my husbands face, his eyes looking in the direction of my body. Lifting the covers up I soon understood why, seeing the blacken scars engraved into my body, a result of my recent battle. Meekly he told me that while the healers were sure I would live, the wounds inflicted on my body would leave deformed scars that would never heal. For a moment I sat still, as I contemplated what to say. Then smiling any without hesitation I looked up, pulling off the covers and made to stand. Pain surged through me as I did so but I stood in front of my husband nonetheless.

Awain's eyes darted around and his mouth stammered, until I looked him in his eyes and made my way over to kiss him. Raising my head I stated to him in a quiet tone, "I do not care how I look as long as you Awain still love me. That alone is enough for me to continue on." At this his body relaxed as I slowly descended to kiss him once more, being embraced within his arms. As I drew closer to him he quietly gave the response, "Yes Fay, I still do,” before he finally began to kiss me back. I remember that night as being one of my most cherished moments in my life. Despite my many travels and life prior I would change nothing for it.

Yet despite the incident that had brought me so close to dying, I knew in my heart that I yearned to leave Elvala once more for adventure. One may think it odd, but at the moment I left with Aranion from the exterior of the Shroud I was reminded of my initial travels that had brought me to Elvala in the first place. Though it has taken a couple decades for me to recover, I now prepare to exit through the Shroud once more to explore the world. Awain deeply disagrees with my decision to leave, but out of his love for me he won't stop me from going. I also know that should I ever truly find myself in danger I can use the Rune of Return still inscribed on me to return from danger.

From what I've learned from the Shaloren scouts there is now much happening outside Elvala's walls to serve as destinations to visit. Lawless bands of men now roam the nearby lands, some driven to banditry by desperation, others seeing an opportunity to take from others as a result of Nargols being unable to exact control over their lands as they once did. Despite our seclusion, it is a problem that affects us here in Elvala as well, as what little interaction we have with the outside world is made even more difficult. It is believed that a major hideout and staging area for attacks can be found in the Old Forest just to the north of here.

Rumours of those magic hating zealots are also abound as are the heinous atrocities that they commit. Their reach is vast and it is believed that they are influencing the politics of many Human Kingdoms and the Eldoral Halflings. No longer content to act in the shadows, trained bands of their anti-magic warriors scour the lands for any who cast magic or are in possession of items powered by the arcane. Curiously there is speculation about some ogres fighting among their ranks, though how that is possible I don't know. Still, I should be careful should I run into one of their traveling groups as I would have a difficult fight on my hands to be sure.

Outside of the various movements of such distasteful groups, some of the shaloren researching the effects caused by the Spellblaze believe that the most prevalent mark of destruction can likely be found along the Blackened Shoreline to the east of Elvala. This was the initial path that the destructive energies of the Spellblaze took and it is reasoned that a better understanding can be obtained by visiting the area. However, the shaloren know that venturing out past the Shroud would be dangerous, not to mention how hazardous those lands are. Despite the dangers, though, it is important to know just what sort of lasting damage the Spellblaze has left on our world.

[i]I won't be discouraged from leaving Elvala because of the battle I lost with the necromancer, though that doesn't mean I will rashly throw my life away either. There are people who need help and villainous schemes to be thwarted and if I can help with this task then I shall. I will be cautious in whatever I pursue in the outside world and you can be sure, Awain, that I will soon be writing another book of my escapades. Wait for me my dear husband for when I come home you know that the first thing I will do is return to your arms. But for now I set off from this land I call home to offer aid where I can.[/i] ]], [[最后，我从我丈夫那里知道了那一天发生的故事，并详细地了解了战斗后发生的事情。死灵法师显然已经逃走了，或者也许，他默许了艾伦尼恩和我一起撤退回埃尔瓦拉。我差点就要死了，但是治疗人员不知疲倦地工作来稳定我的病情，尽管由于魔法大爆炸对我的身体产生的奇怪影响，以及死灵法师的咒语对我身体造成的可怕伤害，他们的工作十分艰难。我在医疗机构呆了很多天，医生们努力挽救我的生命，最后在我丈夫的照顾下被重新安置到我自己的家里。

这时，我丈夫的脸上显露出了一种阴沉的表情，他的眼睛朝着我身体的方向望去。掀开被子，我很快就明白了为什么，因为我看到了自己的身体上刻着的黑色伤疤，这是我最近地战斗带来的结果。他谦恭地告诉我，虽然治疗师确信我会活着，但我身上的伤口会留下永远无法愈合的畸形疤痕。我静静地坐了一会儿，想着说什么。然后毫不犹豫地微笑着，我抬起头，扯下被子，站了起来。当我这样做的时候，痛苦涌上心头，但我还是这样赤身站在我丈夫面前。

艾尔温的眼睛飞快地转来转去，嘴里结巴着，我看着他的眼睛，走过去与他相吻。我抬起头，平静地对他说：“只要你还爱我，我不在乎我的样子，这一点就足够了。”在这一刻，他的身体放松了下来，我慢慢蹲下身体，再次亲吻他，拥抱在他的怀里。我贴近他的身体，他平静地回答说：“是的，菲，我仍然爱你”，然后他又一次吻上了我的嘴唇了。那晚是我一生中最珍贵的时刻之一。尽管我经历了许多旅行和生活，但有些事情永远不会改变。
    
然而，尽管这件事让我濒临死亡，但我心里明白，我渴望再次离开埃尔瓦拉去冒险。有人可能会觉得很奇怪，但当我与埃尔瓦拉一起离开前往帷幕外面的那一刻，我想起了最初带我去埃尔瓦拉的旅行。虽然我花了几十年的时间才恢复过来，但现在我准备再一次走出帷幕去探索这个世界。艾尔温不同意我离开的决定，但出于他对我的爱，他不会阻止我离开。我也知道，如果我真的发现自己处于危险之中，我可以使用仍然刻在我身上的返回符文来从危险中返回。

根据我从永恒精灵侦察兵那里听到的消息，现在，在埃尔瓦拉的城墙外发生了值得我关注的事情。一群法外狂徒正在附近的土地上游荡，有些人因绝望而沦为土匪，另一些人则因为纳格尔人无法像以前那样掌控对自己领土的控制，而找到了乘机占山为王的机会。尽管我们与世隔绝，但这也是影响在埃尔瓦拉的我们的一个重要问题，因为这让我们与外界仅有的少许互动变得更加困难。据信，在这里北边的古老森林里是这群土匪的一个主要的藏身处和攻击集结地。

关于那些憎恨魔法的狂热者的谣言比比皆是，他们犯下的令人发指的暴行也是如此。他们的势力范围很广，据信他们正在影响许多人类王国和艾德瑞尔半身人的政治。他们不再满足于在黑暗中行动，排除训练有素的反魔法战士们，在土地上搜捕任何施放魔法或拥有奥术装备的人。奇怪的是，有人说还有一些食人魔会在他们的队伍中战斗，尽管我不知道这是怎么做到的。不过，如果我遇到他们的巡逻队，还是要万分小心，因为这肯定会是一场艰难的战斗。

除了这些令人厌恶的群体的各种活动之外，一些研究魔法大爆炸所造成影响的永恒精灵人认为，最普遍的破坏痕迹很可能出现在埃尔瓦拉以东变黑的海岸线上。这是魔法大爆炸破坏能量的最初路径，如果访问这片区域，能对魔法大爆炸的影响产生更加深入理解。然而，永恒精灵人知道，冒险穿过帷幕已经足够危险，更不用说那些土地有多危险了。尽管危险重重，但重要的是要知道魔法大爆炸给我们的世界带来了什么样的持久伤害。

[i]我不会因为和死灵法师的战斗而气馁，拒绝离开埃尔瓦拉，但这也并不意味着我会轻率地放弃我的生命。到处都有需要被帮助的人，和需要被挫败的邪恶计划，如果我能帮助完成这些任务，那么我就会竭尽全力。无论我在外面的世界里追求什么，我都会小心翼翼。我可以向你保证，艾尔温，我很快就会写另一本关于我的冒险的书。等我回来，亲爱的丈夫，你知道我要做的第一件事就是回到你的怀抱。但现在，我要从这片被我称为家园的土地出发，尽我所能地为这个世界提供帮助。[/i] ]], "_t")

t([[The story of Kroshkkur is not a peaceful one. Those of us who gathered here know that we have no place anywhere else. The surface would never accept us, for our forms are terrible for them to behold. Even in the depths of Eyal, we have had to fight for our place in the world. These endless tunnels and the creatures within them have sought to destroy us. They hunger for our very souls.

When Kroshkkur was first discovered, it was infested with horrors. We cut them down and attempted to restore the strange arcane machines we found here. Alas, we found it to be damaged and could only partially restore it. But, even that small amount of power it held was enough to give us safety. Many followed us after that, outcasts who were looking for a haven in a hostile underground. Intelligent beings who do not belong anywhere else, seekers of forbidden knowledge and those who have seen too much for mortal eyes to bear are just a few who have made their homes here.

Since then, we have studied. We have divined this world's secrets and delved into the dark places which surface dwellers dare not look, out of fear of what might be looking back. We have no such fear, for we are the things looking back. In these places, we have found out many truths and discovered magic which will change the course of Eyal's history.

We will bide our time down here in the dark and turn this place into a beacon of knowledge. If this world will not give us a place in it, then we shall simply take one for ourselves. We shall make ourselves known to the surface when the time is right, and show them that we aren't just scattered, mindless beings for them to sweep aside.]], [[克诺什库尔的往事并不安宁。聚集在这里的人们都知道自己别无归宿。地表上的人们永远不会接受我们，因为在他们眼中我们的姿态太过恐怖。而就算在埃亚尔的地下深处，我们的容身之地也来之不易。在无尽的地道居住着的生物日夜追杀着我们，想将我们的灵魂吞噬殆尽。

我们最初发现克诺什库尔时，里面住满了恐魔。我们杀了它们，并试图修复这里奇怪的奥术机械，但它损坏严重，我们只能将其部分修复。但仅仅是它所具有的这一小部分力量，也足以给我们带来安宁。之后，更多流浪者追随着我们来到了这里，以在充满敌意的地下寻求一处庇护。他们当中有在别处无处容身的智慧生物、有寻求着禁忌知识的先知，还有目睹了太多凡人的目光所不能承受之物的人。

之后我们便开始学习。我们领悟了世界的秘密，潜入了地表居民看都不敢看，恐惧着被其中不知是什么的东西凝望的无尽深渊。我们并没有这种恐惧，因为我们正是在其中凝视着他们的那些存在。 在这些地方，我们找到了许多真相，发现了能够改变埃亚尔历史进程的禁忌魔法。

我们会在这片黑暗之中等待着时机，将这里变成一座知识的灯塔。如果这个世界不给我们容身之处，我们就自己去夺取它。当时机正确之时，我们就将让地表知道我们的存在，告诉他们，我们并不只是一群被他们当做害虫一样轻轻扫开的，毫无心智的乌合之众。]], "_t")

The only thing that is common among all of us is that we simply don't belong anywhere. With conscious minds, we can plainly understand the horrors of Eyal's depths. With twisted and corrupted bodies, no 'civilised' people would tolerate our presence among them. When we reside in Kroshkurr, however, we are craftsmen, scholars, hermits, poets and warriors.

To that end, we all gather here. Are we spiteful for how this world openly rejects us? It would be a lie if we said no. To that end, we shall plunge head first into the places no one else dares look. We shall use the dark secrets of this world to carve out our own place in it.

因此，我们聚集在这里。要问我们是否憎恨这个如此排斥我们的世界，说“不”那只能是在说谎。因此，我们投身其他人看都不敢看的深渊，用这个世界阴暗的秘密来创造自己的容身之处。当上方的世界还在睡梦中时，我们正在创造着奇迹。]], "_t")

t("Researcher Dremnot's Demystification of the Gods: Prelude", "研究员德瑞姆诺特的揭露诸神：前言", "_t")
t([[Gods are beings which have been frequently mentioned throughout Eyal's history. They are a foreign concept to most readers, since most Eyalites of the current age have not encountered them. The word god gives you the impression of some almighty and obscenely powerful being, which these beings most certainly are. But, there has been little scholarly work dedicated to defining what exactly a god is. Multiple cultures across Eyal's history all have varying descriptions of the gods, despite the same names frequently appearing among them. 

As a scholar of Kroshkkur, I spent much time wandering the surface of Eyal and learning from the surface races regarding the gods, including many famous places of learning such as Anglowen. It was a hard sell, but I even managed to [i]convince[/i] an imp to retrieve certain documentation on Urk'Rok as well. This series of documents has been written to catalogue information regarding the gods and to develop as accurate a picture of them as myth and history will allow and this preface is to give a general impression of what exactly a god is supposed to be.

There have been many powerful beings who have walked across the surface of Eyal. Being a god isn't simply a question of power, however, despite the enormous strength of these beings. What separates gods from other beings is their ability to reverse entropy. For future reference, we shall refer to this power as antropy. This power also allows them to reshape reality to their own whims and desires. Some gods made their own races, others merely altered beings living on Eyal, playing with their evolution and changing them in unfathomable ways. While some might attribute this behaviour to some greater purpose, there is more than enough evidence to suggest that the gods are fallible and motivated by things just as petty as we mere mortals. In my scholarly opinion, we were simply created for their amusement.

While this might drive some to despair and make them believe that mortal will is pointless, it is noted in ancient myth that the gods were slaughtered by the Sher'tul and driven away from our world. Whether or not their absence can be considered a good thing, it cannot be said. There are some surviving stories of the gods' blatant cruelty and complete disregard for the races they made as they squabbled among each other, wracking great scars across the surface of this world. It is also noteworthy that the gods, despite their impressive power, were not always intelligent beings. Some were believed to be barely sapient, or even sentient. One theory about this is that the gods were primitive beings living on Eyal's surface and just so happened to be infused with antropic energies, artificially elevating them above other primitive lifeforms.

With these things established, we will discuss the gods of Eyal and what influence their actions had, and continue to have, on our world. While I discovered many gods in my studies, it is entirely possible that Eyal had even more gods than what are documented in my findings, but their existence cannot be substantiated by existing scholarly texts.]], [[神是埃亚尔历史上经常被提及的存在。它们对大部分读者来说是个陌生的概念，因为当代的大部分埃亚尔人都从未遇见过它们。“神”这个字给人的印象是至高全能的存在，这点它们也名副其实。但是学术上几乎没有对神的具体定义。埃亚尔历史上的诸多文化虽然都提到了许多相同的名讳，但对诸神的描述则各不相同。 

作为一名克诺什库尔的学者，我在埃亚尔地表游历了许多时间，在包括安格列文在内的诸多知识圣地学习了地表种族对神的认识。我甚至[i]说服[/i]了一个小恶魔去取来有关乌鲁洛克的一些文件，尽管过程并不轻松。我博览传说与历史，写下这一系列的文件来尽可能准确地记载诸神的信息，而这章前言则是让读者大致了解神究竟是何物。

曾经有诸多强大的存在行走于埃亚尔的地表，而虽然它们都有着无与伦比的力量，但要成为神并非只需要力量这么简单。将神与其他生物区分开来的是它们能够逆转熵的力量，我们会在下文中将其称作反熵。这种力量使它们能够根据自己的意志重塑现实。有些神创造了自己的种族，另一些只是变化已有的存在，玩弄着它们的演化或是以其他高深莫测的方法改变它们。有些人认为，神这么做是为了更远大的目标，但也有十足证据表明诸神就和凡人一样容易冲动并犯下错误。以我学术上的观点，它们创造出我们仅仅是为了娱乐。

虽然这会使某些人相信凡人的意志毫无意义因而陷入绝望，但传说诸神曾被夏·图尔人杀戮并被赶出了我们的世界。它们的消失是好是坏这不好说。根据一些残留下来的传说中的记载，诸神十分残暴，在相互的纷争之中完全不顾它们所创造的种族的生死，还在地面上留下了巨大的伤痕。以及诸神虽然力量强大，但并不一定聪明。有些神被认为是毫无智能，甚至是毫无认知的。有一种相关的理论认为诸神原本只是些生活在埃亚尔地表的原始存在，只是碰巧获得了反熵的力量，才让他们高居于其他原始的生命形态之上。

在这些概念的基础之上，我们将继续讨论埃亚尔的诸神，以及它们的行为对我们的世界有过，以及将会带来怎样的影响。虽然我在研究中发现了许多神，但埃亚尔完全可能存在更多我记载之外的神，只是它们的存在学术上无法考证。]], "_t")
t("Researcher Dremnot's Demystification of the Gods: Chapter 1 - Amakthel", "研究员德瑞姆诺特的揭露诸神：第一章 阿马克泰尔", "_t")
t([[Even among the gods, there was one that towered above them all. Its name was Amakthel, mightiest of Eyal's gods. It was said that it was the creator of the Sher'Tul, that ancient and mysterious race whose true nature is still unknown to this day. More than any other god, Amakthel appears as a creation figure in ancient myths, more readily interfering with mortal beings than any other god. Nearly every race has some myth of Amakthel coming into contact with them, some describing it as a glowing, divine being while others declared it as a bringer of ill omens. Its touch seemed to curse as readily as it blessed according to these different sources, altering beings in ways that only made sense to Amakthel itself. As such, it is difficult to get a clear picture of Amakthel's true personality and disposition towards mortals.

How exactly Amakthel's downfall came is not certain. Some myths say that the Sher'Thul were commanded by their creator to kill the gods, while others suggest that the Sher'Tul openly rebelled against them. ]], [[即使在诸神之中也存在着一个凌驾于它们所有之上的存在，其名为阿马克泰尔，埃亚尔诸神中的最强者。据说正是它创造了夏·图尔人，那个我们至今仍然知之甚少的古老而神秘的种族。在古老的传说中，相比其他神，阿马克泰尔宛如真正的造物主，时刻准备着干预凡间的事物。几乎所有种族都有阿马克泰尔与他们接触的传说，有些将其描述为浑身散发着光芒的圣人，另一些则声称它是不祥预兆的使者。在不同的记述中，它的到来既被看作祝福也被看作诅咒，以只有它自己理解的方式改变着世界。因此，很难清楚地描述阿马克泰尔的真实个性和对凡人的倾向。

阿马克泰尔究竟是如何覆殁的并不清楚。有些传说是夏·图尔人受其创造者的命令杀死了诸神，另一些则说是夏·图尔人公开起义反对它们。]], "_t")

t([[Ralkur, the god of illusions and deceit, was perhaps the most petty god of Eyal. The myths of Ralkur are often tragedies, describing the downfall of its titular character after trusting a mysterious stranger. Due to the consistency of these stories, it can be concluded that Ralkur did not care for meddling with things on a large scale, but preferred a much smaller one. It delighted in understanding what drove mortal races and how it could bring a single person to ruin with nothing but words and clever lies. It always revealed itself at the end of the tale, its hapless victim realising that they had been fooled all along. In this sense, Ralkur was cruel in a way that was distinct from the other gods.

When the god slayer Branzir came for it, Ralkur came to know fear and fled. The chase between god and god slayer was the stuff of legend, and many myths tell of the great trials which Branzir overcame in his pursuit of Ralkur. In the last moments of the chase, Ralkur was spared and told to leave Eyal by Branzir. However, Ralkur later returned and struck a terrible blow against Branzir's homestead, slaying his family and his servants. The already driven Branzir became obsessed with Ralkur and chased it across the entirety of Eyal. Having nowhere else to run after stumbling into a dungeon, Ralkur chose to go down into Eyal's depths, creating layer upon layer of illusions, creatures and distractions to prevent the relentless Branzir from catching it. Since no one can enter this dungeon without leaving, it can only be guessed at how deep the dungeon has become. Some say it is even infinite and that the chase between hunter and hunted continues to this day.]], [[瑞尔克，幻象与欺骗之神，或许是埃亚尔最卑劣的神了。有关瑞尔克的传说通常都是悲剧，描述着主人公相信了一个神秘的陌生人之后的悲惨落幕。这些故事都相当一致，因而可以认为瑞尔克并不在乎大规模地影响世界格局，而爱好干一些小事。他以通晓凡人的行为与动机，以及如何只用花言巧语去毁掉一个人为乐。在故事的最后，他会向悲惨的主人公揭示自己的身份，让他们意识到自己从一开始就被欺骗了。由此看来，瑞尔克的残忍与其他诸神还有所不同。

当弑神者布兰伊尔前来了结瑞尔克之时，它感到了恐惧而逃跑了。这场弑神者与神之间的追逐留下了许多传奇，诉说着布兰伊尔在追猎的路上克服了怎样的艰难险阻。最终，布兰伊尔饶恕了瑞尔克，叫它离开埃亚尔。但不久之后瑞尔克卷土重来，并且给布兰伊尔的故乡带来了巨大的灾难，杀光了他的家人和仆从。因而布兰伊尔誓死要猎杀瑞尔克，走遍了整个埃亚尔去追捕它。瑞尔克迫不得已躲进一座地下城之后无路可走，只能逃往埃亚尔地下深处，沿途创造了一层又一层的幻象和其中的生物、威胁，以阻止一往无前的布兰伊尔追到自己。因为没有人到达过这座地下城的底层，因而人们只能猜测它现在的深度，有些人认为它的深度是无尽的，这场猎杀甚至到今日还未结束。]], "_t")

t([[Gerlyk, according to some ancient myths, is the creator of humanity and interacted the most with them during those times. Its contact with humanity seems dubious, however, when other sources are consulted. It interacted with mortals on its own whims and did not seem to particularly favour any species according to these stories. It seemed to be a more curious god than others, as a handful of myths mention it making contact with mortals so it could learn more about how they lived. The myths surrounding Gerlyk are noticeably less numerous than those of other gods and there appears to be large time gaps between them, suggesting that Gerlyk simply did not interact with Eyalites for the most part. For this reason, it is seen to be a god who observed, but didn't interfere.

During the Godhunt, there are no records indicating that any of the God Slayers slew Gerlyk or even found it. This suggests that the god hid somewhere even the Sher'tul could not find it.]], [[根据一些古代传说的记载，盖里克是人类一族的创造者，并且在过去与他们有着最多的交往。但据其他来源的信息，它与人类之间交往的记载并不可靠。在这些故事里，它只是偶尔心血来潮才与凡人接触，而且并没有特别青睐某些种族。它看起来比其他诸神更具好奇心，在不少传说中它与凡人交往，是为了了解他们是如何生活的。与盖里克有关的传说明显少于其他诸神的，时间上看相互之间也有着较大的间隔，就好像盖里克大部分时候并不会与埃亚尔的居民接触。因此比起一个影响着世界的神，他看起来更像是一个观察者。

t([[Quekorja was the god of time and possibilities. What stands out about Eyal's myths regarding Quekorja is how wildly inconsistent they are. In particular, tales after the Godhunt tend to have a far less favourable outlook of the god than pre-Godhunt myths. Speculation regarding this is due to Quekorja supposedly taking an interest in written history and appointing its own librarians to record its tales. Since there are no surviving records of this library existing, this theory is considered to be pure conjecture and has no concrete evidence to validate it. There have been some unusual records found too, supposedly written by the same authors on the same dates, but wildly varying in their tone and their description of the god itself. Given the god's ability to control time, it is thought these notes might be from alternate timelines, further obscuring the truth about the god itself.

According to the records of Anglowen, Quekorja was slain during the Godhunt and its body discovered by the mage Linaniil. Linaniil managed to absorb a small portion of the god's power through a dangerous ritual. This tiny shard of power she acquired made her an archmage without peer, a testament to the sheer might of the gods.]], [[奎科加是时间和可能性之神，它的传说唯一的特点就是变化万千，而在弑神之战之后的传说中它的形象远不如前。对此的猜测是Quekorja自己可能十分爱好书写历史，指派了自己的记录者来记录自己的故事，但并没有证据表明有这样一个图书馆存在，因而这种理论被认为只是没有依据的臆测，没有实际证据的支持。另外还有一些不寻常的记录，本应是同一个作者在同一天写的，但其语调和对此神的描述却大相径庭。由于奎科加能够操控时间，因而有观点认为这些记录其实是来自别的时间线。这更加增添了奎科加的神秘。

As such, it was attributed in many mythologies to the creation of numerous diseases and plagues. Some myths stated that there was necessity to Xadoch's presence, as its plagues prevented any one race dominating the world and kept a balance of sorts. On the other hand, many other myths attest that the god had a cruel curiosity. It spread blight across the world and created diseases just to see what sort of effect they would have on sapient life. If it weren't for the other gods on Eyal, it is believed that Xadoch would have scoured the entire world of sapient life.

Xadoch was one of the first gods to be felled in the God Hunt by the hunter Branzir. The Sher'tul had a particular dislike of the god, as it had tried to undermine them with plagues numerous times. Strains of Xadoch's diseases are thought to still be on Eyal to this day, waiting for some unfortunate victim to carry them back to civilisation, so Xadoch may commit one last act of spite against sapient life.]], [[亚多契被称作“枯萎编织者”，喜爱爬行在烂泥之上、匍匐在污秽之中的生物，但对智慧生物毫无感情。因而在许多神话体系中它都被描述为疾病和瘟疫的缔造者。有些神话声称亚多契的存在是必需的，因为它带来的瘟疫会阻止任何种族统治世界而维持着某种平衡；而另一些则坚信此神有着一种残忍的好奇心，它在世上散布腐败、创造疾病只是为了观看这些对智慧生物有何影响。有人认为如果没有埃亚尔其他诸神的阻拦，亚多契早已将智慧生物灭绝了。

亚多契是弑神之战中被杀死的第一批神之一，被布兰伊尔说啥。夏·图尔人尤其厌恶此神，因为它曾数次试图用瘟疫来危害他们。有人认为亚多契的疾病的贻害至今仍然残留在埃亚尔，等待着不幸的人将其带回文明世界，带来亚多契对智慧生物的最后一击。]], "_t")

t([[Ugg'matho was the god responsible for the creation of the trolls. While most Eyalites of the current age think of trolls as dumb brutes, they have frequently proven themselves to be far more clever than they're given credit for. The most commonly attributed dominions of Ugg'matho were the forests and mountains of Eyal. In ancient texts, the title bestowed upon it was 'The Gardener,' for it deeply loved the forests and green places of Eyal. It is thought that it created the trolls in its own image, as savage and powerful stewards of the wild places.

In some legends, there are tales of it reaching down from the sky and annihilating settlements, for it saw civilisation as a blemish on the green canvas of Eyal's surface. In others, it instead chose to alter nature itself to stave off civilisation, creating various plants and guardians to prevent sapient races from plundering its forests for resources. The recurring theme of many of its myths is that it was vehemently opposed to sapient beings living out of harmony with nature.

Ugg'matho was frequently in conflict with other gods in its myths. Many a story tells of how the gods and their chosen champions went on great troll hunts in the wilderness, chasing down Ugg'matho's children in order to wipe them from the face of Eyal. While the tales often described their great success in ridding the wilderness of the troll menace, the sheer number of them throughout the ages suggests that they were not as successful as they made out. One myth stated that Ugg'matho eventually struck a deal with the other gods where they would leave its forests alone and it would leave their creations alone in return. Another states that Ugg'matho was made to submit by the other gods and begrudgingly continued to undermine them in secret.

When Ugg'matho was slained by Branzir, it is said that its blood took on a life of its own, spreading out into the wilderness in the form of living ooze.]], [[厄格莫斯是创造了巨魔的神。虽然当代大部分埃亚尔居民都认为巨魔只是些愚蠢、野蛮的大块头，它们却经常展现出出人意料的智慧。厄格莫斯的主要领地是埃亚尔的森林和山区，它在古老的文献中被称作“园丁”，因为它深爱着埃亚尔的森林和其他绿地。有人认为它是按照自己的形象创造了巨魔——野蛮而强大的荒野守护者。

有些传说中它会从天空中降临并毁灭文明的聚居点，因为它将文明视作埃亚尔这一片绿色风景上的污点；而在另一些神话中它则选择改变自然来避让文明，并创造出众多的植物和守卫来防止智慧种族去掠夺森林的资源。它的许多传说都有一个共性，那就是它强烈反对智慧生物去打破自然平衡。

在传说中厄格莫斯经常与其他神争斗，有许多故事讲述了诸神和它们选中的勇士是如何开展猎杀巨魔的行动以试图将厄格莫斯的孩子彻底从埃亚尔上抹去的，而虽然这些行动通常被描述为非常成功，现在世上的巨魔数量表明事实可能并非如此。有一则传说声称厄格莫斯最后与其他诸神定下了一个协定——它们不再来侵扰它的森林，而它也不再去侵扰它们的造物；另一则则声称厄格莫斯被迫屈服于其他诸神，只能在暗中继续危害它们。

All of the myths regarding Urh'Rok depict him as being a benevolent and thoughtful god, one which had a deep and intimate relationship with his creations. The demons affectionately refer to him as their Father and they have nothing but praise to sing of him. Since there are not many different sources to cross reference, it may not be possible to get an unbiased examination of Urh'Rok's personality.

Their homeworld is described as a collection of fragmented continents held together only by Urh'Rok's will. According to the demons, this was the result of a great cataclysm which came through a Sher'Thul far portal. Their records state this cataclysm occurred roughly at the same time as the Spellblaze did on Eyal. This suggests that the Spellblaze had far reaching consequences beyond our current understanding and could have impacted multiple worlds.

Despite the benevolent and gentle demeanour he has been attributed in his myths, demons have frequently declared their atrocities committed against Eyalites in his name. This contrast in his attitude toward Eyalites and his own creations does not suggest a benevolent disposition, but rather one similar to a father protecting his spoiled children.

恶魔的家乡被描述为一片破碎的大陆，仅仅因为乌鲁洛克的意志才聚集在一起。据恶魔们说，这是一场从夏·图尔人的远古传送门中释放出的巨大灾难造成的结果。根据它们的记载，这场灾难发生的时间与魔法大爆炸大致吻合，提示魔法大爆炸的影响可能触及了众多的世界而远远超出我们的理解。

虽然乌鲁洛克在神话中的形象和蔼可亲，恶魔们却经常以他的名义来对埃亚尔的居民实施各种暴力。这种对埃亚尔居民和他自己的造物截然相反的态度表明他并非真的仁慈，而更像是一个保护着、溺爱着孩子的父亲。他的存在证明了神并非仅仅是埃亚尔独有的现象，还可能存在于其他无数的世界之上。]], "_t")

The Sher'Tul are believed to have mastered many forms of technology, magical spells and psionic techniques. There is not a single force on Eyal then or now which could hope to match their might.

His standing in Sher'tul society is not completely clear, but given the resources he commanded and his influence over the Sher'tul, it's thought that he was one of their leaders, or at least a prominent figure in Sher'tul society.

The Godhunt started because Amakthel commanded the Sher'tul to slay the other gods. Caldizar personally went out and audited potential candidates to wield the Godslayer weapons. He too chose to wield a Godslayer, becoming the leader of the nine who would take part in the Godhunt. However, as the Godslayers did their work, they began to think about how Amakthel was using them as tools to meet its own ends. Their creator, while it wielded great power, had the intellectual capacity of an infant compared to the Sher'tul.

In the end, it was Caldizar who commanded the Sher'tul to slay Amakthel. It was thought that this command was not carried out by all Sher'tul and was, in fact, openly reviled by many of them, leading to conflicts within their ranks. There are no records of the Sher'tul after the Godhunt ended, let alone of Caldizar. No one is certain what became of their race.

He carried a plain iron staff with him wherever he walked, an antiquated weapon which he cherished deeply.

t([[The krog are perhaps the youngest of the intelligent races of Maj'Eyal, only coming into existence recently. They claim that they were formerly ogres that have had their runes removed, somehow surviving having their runes replaced by a combination of natural infusions and drakes blood. The removal of their runes was orchestrated by the Ziguranth, who apparently decided action needed to be taken to prevent all ogres from being horribly and brutally killed as a result of the Spellhunt, leading to the creation of the krog. The official reasons given by the Ziguranth for this action was that the ogres were unfortunate victims of magic rather then perpetrators of it, and the Ziguranth were just looking to help to free them from the taint of the arcane.

Due to the fact that they were originally ogres, it comes as no surprise that the two races share much with each other. They tend to have similar hair coloring, facial features, and other similar traits. The average krog is a bit shorter then a ogre at 8'2" and perhaps a little leaner, but otherwise the rest of their body dimensions remain the same. One would likely be hard pressed to distinguish a krog from an ogre or vice versa if it wasn't for the heavy tint of greens and browns within their eyes and skin, likely a side effect of whatever natural process the Ziguranth employed to strip them of their runes.

The majority of the krog tend to live in or around the middle of the continent where the heart of Ziguranth territory lies and they have been known to take up arms in service to the anti-magic cause. Indeed one may find that the majority of any Ziguranth Patrol one may encounter is usually made up of krog fighters. All krog seem to demonstrate some connection to nature as well as possessing abilities to combat mages, not to mention harbor a huge hatred towards anyone that deals with magic in any way. Indeed, a krog's disdain for the arcane begs the question if perhaps the Ziguranth did a bit more then just remove the runes from their bodies.

Commonly when they are not in the employ of the Ziguranth, or otherwise answering the call to do battle with a rogue mage, the krog have been known to contract themselves out as laborers to whomever may hire them. Like ogres, krog are also known for having impressive appetites and one can find many krog farmers plowing fields to grow food for themselves to eat. They are also known for their talents in mixing infusions, producing the majority of what one might find in the markets around the continent.

Of course no analysis of the krog would be complete without mentioning the many stories, songs, and artwork that revolve around their many pursuits. A lot of encouragement is directed at younger krogs by their peers to venture out into the world and perform heroic deeds. This course of action seems less to do with valor, glory, or riches; something one might expect of a typical 'adventurer' and more to do with the mistrust that followed them formerly being ogres. In an effort to combat their initial image they had as former ogres, the krog sought to commit themselves to gaining a new image through achievement of impressive feats. To this end they seem to have been rather successful as evidenced by the creation of the many artistic works told about them. ]], [[克罗格也许是马基·埃亚尔最年轻的智慧种族，直到最近才出现。他们声称，他们曾经是食人魔，然而已经去除了身上的符文。通过某种方式，他们天生的符文被天然的纹身和龙血所替代。去除他们身上的符文的行为是由伊格兰斯组织的。为了防止食人魔被魔法狩猎的行动可怕而残忍的杀害灭族，他们创造了克罗格一族。伊格兰斯对此给出的官方理由是，因为食人魔只是魔法力量不幸的受害者，而不是行使者，他们希望帮助食人魔脱离奥术能量的玷污。

由于他们原本是食人魔，因而，两个种族之间有这么多共同点也就不让人意外了。克罗格和食人魔具有相同的发色，面部特征、以及其他很多相似的特征。克罗格平均8英尺2英寸，只比食人魔稍矮一些，也许稍微瘦一些，但其他的身体尺寸保持不变。如果不是他们的眼睛和皮肤颜色不同，一般人很难区分克罗格和食人魔。克罗格的眼睛和皮肤上有浓厚的绿色和棕色，可能是伊格兰斯用自然力量剥去他们身上符文产生的副作用。

大部分克罗格生活在伊格兰斯领地的核心地带，他们通常志愿为反魔法事业效力战斗。事实上，人们可能会发现，你遇到的大多数伊格兰斯巡逻队通常由克罗格战士组成。所有的克罗格都表现出与大自然的联系，并且拥有与法师战斗的能力。更不用说，他们对以任何形式行使魔法的人都怀有巨大的仇恨。事实上，克罗格对奥术的强烈蔑视，让人不禁怀疑，伊格兰斯在它们身上做的改动，恐怕不仅仅是把纹身从他们身上移走而已。

一般来说，当他们没有受到伊格兰斯的雇佣，也没有独自和法师战斗的时候，克罗格常常作为劳工，接受任何人的雇佣。就像食人魔一样，克罗格也以令人印象深刻的食欲而闻名，人们可以在农村找到许多克罗格农民，他们生产供自己食用的食物。他们以混合纹身的才能而闻名，可以生产大部分在大陆市场上可以找到的东西。

当然，如果不提到有关描写他们的冒险精神的许多故事，诗歌和图画，就不能完整理解克罗格文化。年轻的克罗格在他们的同辈的大力鼓励下，常常追求在世界上进行冒险，表现出英勇的行为。克罗格对冒险的热爱，不仅来自于热血，荣耀，或者是财富这种和人们眼中传统的“冒险家”相关的东西，更来自于人们对于曾是食人魔的他们的不信任感。为了弥除他们曾是食人魔给人带来的不好的偏见，克罗格在各个领域都试图取得令人印象深刻的成就，从而证明自己，树立新的形象。正如许多艺术创作中所表现出来的一样，他们的努力证明了自己独立的地位。]], "_t")

t([[Eyal's underground is abundant with strange, and not particularly wholesome, creatures. Many of them are mindless monstrosities, unable to be reasoned with and best left alone. However, perhaps the most unusual of these creatures are the Drem. For the longest time, Drem were presumed to simply be another form of horror which dwelled in Eyal's underground. The recent emergence of thinking Drem, however, has forced many scholars to reassess their race as a whole.

A Drem is roughly the same height as a Dwarf and has a vaguely similar facial structure as well. This is where the similarities between the two races tend to end. Drem have no distinguishing facial features and are incapable of growing beards like dwarves, instead growing wiry and unkempt patches of hair which vary greatly in thickness. Due to the lack of facial features such as eyes, ears, a mouth and a nose, it is not currently known how a Drem eats or how they sense things around them. The mental faculties of thinking Drem seems to vary wildly from each individual as well. Some are barely more capable of rational thought than feral Drem, while others have gained intellect comparable to the brightest minds of Eyal.

As they have only recently come out of their previously mindless states, the Drem are a people who are completely disconnected with the world around them. They possess no cultural identity or history to fall back on and sit on the precipice between the civilised races of Eyal's surface and the horrors of Eyal's underground. Many suspect that they possess some connection to the dwarves, the prevailing theory being that they are some sort of corrupted offshoot of that proud race. There has been little research into the subject and little evidence found to substantiate these claims, however. What impact the Drem will have on Eyal's future can only be speculated upon at this point.]], [[埃亚尔的地下有着各种各样的奇怪，而且不是特别健康的生物。他们中的大部分都是毫无心智的怪物，无法理解，最好不要和他们扯上关系。然而，这些生物中最不寻常的就是德瑞姆了。长期以来，德瑞姆被简单地认为，只是埃亚尔地下的一种恐魔。然而，最近出现了一些能思考的德瑞姆，这迫使学者们对这个种族开始了重新的评价。

德瑞姆的身高与矮人差不多，并且有着大致类似的体态特征。这两个种族的相似点也就到此为止了。德瑞姆没有明显的面部特征，也没有矮人那样的胡须。相应的，他们有着厚度变化很大的蓬松毛发。由于缺乏诸如眼睛，耳朵，嘴巴或是鼻子这样的面部特征，目前既不知道德瑞姆吃什么，也不知道他们如何感知周围的事物。德瑞姆的智力似乎有着很大的个体差异。有的德瑞姆的智力不比野生的怪物好多少，而有的德瑞莫则获得了能够和埃亚尔最聪明的头脑们相媲美的智慧。

由于他们才刚刚脱离过去那种毫无智慧的阶段，德瑞姆是与外部世界完全脱节的一群人。他们没有文化认同，没有历史。他们文明的命运高悬在再悬崖之间，一边是埃亚尔地面上的文明种族，一边是埃亚尔地下的恐魔。许多人怀疑，他们和矮人有某种联系，普遍的理论是，他们是这种骄傲的种族的某种被腐化的后裔。对这个问题的研究很少，而且也很少有证据支持这种说法。目前还不知道德瑞姆会对埃亚尔的未来产生怎么样的影响。]], "_t")

It's like I'm inside a snake with the way it winds and how long it is. Sometimes these meaty bits of something come after me and have acid pouring out of them... I get the impression that it's trying to digest me. I've managed to make a little hideout in one of the folds of its belly, but I don't know how long these protective runes are going to last.

So, I guess my plan is to find a way out of here or to take this thing down with me. For most things, food goes in one end and... Well, you know the rest. But this thing... It just flat out digests everything it swallows. I've watched those things breaking down entire chunks of rock, houses, enough trees to fill a forest... This thing can eat pretty much everything.

With that in mind, my only option is to kill it from the inside. Dunno how I'm going to do that just yet.]], [[你有曾经落入困境，不知怎么办才好的体验吗？嘛，这就是我现在面临的情景。这个东西，不管它是什么，从地里突然钻了出来，把我整个吞了下去。这就像把少女送上祭坛作为怪物的美餐这样的事一样，不过看上去这个怪物正好看上了我。

我曾经见到过各种各样的怪物，像是不死生物，恐魔，或者是有灵能的熊，不过这都没法和这个怪物相提并论。我好像进入了一条蛇的体内，感受着它的蜿蜒蠕动，不知道它有多长。有的时候，一些肉块会向我爬来，朝我喷吐酸液…我可以感受到，这个怪物似乎想要消化我。我努力在他腹部的一个皱褶里做了一个小小的避难所，但我不知道这些保护符文还能支撑多久。

所以，我想我的计划应该是找到一条出路，或者让这个家伙和我一起下地狱。对于大部分的生物来说，吃下去的食物最终都会到…嗯，你懂的。但对于这个怪物…它似乎只是不停地消化着它吞下去的一切。我可以看到，这个东西吞噬着整块巨石，房屋，足够填满森林的数目…这家伙真是啥都能吃。

考虑到这一点，我唯一的选择就是从内部杀死它。不知道我现在该怎么做。]], "_t")

t([[So, what does an adventurer do when they get bored with it all? For me, I wanted to find a nice castle somewhere out in the countryside and spend the rest of my days in idle contentment. The issue there is that I made a lot of enemies who would have loved for me to settle down in one spot, so I needed to think of a solution.

That's when I found this place. Everyone else avoided it because people never left once they went inside it. Being used to the adventuring life, I saw such a thing as a challenge. Turns out that this cursed castle, as people referred to it, constantly changes its inside layout. No one really knows how or why it does it, but I'm not really one to question such things. If I could just work out the logic behind how it shifted itself, I could have an unassailable fortress. 

However, I also found that this still didn't deter people from coming to kill me. They all swarmed in and although a lot of them got lost in the hallways, a few actually managed to reach me. I had grown rather attached to the place at this point, but neither could I stay there. My solution came with a bizarre tome I had found in my adventures. When I opened the cover and pointed it in the right direction, it could suck things into its very pages.

So, being the savvy adventurer I am, I opened the tome and sucked the entire castle inside of it. It seems like the tome could only suck so much inside its covers, so it could no longer hold anything else in it. Although I had to sacrifice a great treasure, I now had a sanctuary away from the real world which I could escape to whenever I needed shelter.]], [[那么，当一个冒险者厌倦了有关冒险的一切时，他们会做什么呢？对我而言，我想在乡村的某个地方建造一座漂亮的城堡，并在休闲和娱乐中度过愉快的晚年。问题在于，我有不少仇人，他们可是很乐意见到我呆在一个地方束手就擒，因此我得想出一个解决方案。

所以，我找到了这个地方。其他人都对它避之不及，因为据说进入这里的人从来没有回来过。不过习惯了冒险生活的我看来，这样的事情无意是一种挑战。事实证明，这个被诅咒的城堡，正如人们所说的那样，正在不断地改变着他的内部布局。没有人真正知道，它是如何做到这一切，以及为什么要这样做的，但我也不是一个非得刨根问底的人。只要我能弄清楚，尽管它的结构不断的改变，这种改变的内部仍然蕴含了某种逻辑，我就拥有了一个无懈可击的堡垒。

然而我也发现，这并没有阻止我的那些仇人前来送死。他们还在蜂拥而入，虽然他们中的大部分人都在走廊中迷路了，但也有一些人真的到达了我的面前。在那时候，我已经相当喜欢这个地方了，但我也不能一直呆在这里。从我在冒险生活中找到的一本怪书里，我寻找到了一个有趣的解决方案。只要我打开书的封面，朝向正确的方向，它就可以把东西吸入书中。

所以，像我这样聪明的冒险家，很快想到了最好的做法。我打开了这本书，把整个城堡吸入其中。这本书似乎只能吸收书页上能画的下的那么多的东西，之后就再也没法放进任何东西了。虽然我不得不牺牲了我的财富中很大的一部分，不过我现在有了一个远离现实世界的庇护所，每当我需要的时候都可以逃脱到书中。]], "_t")

Whenever I tried to decorate rooms or organise anything in its interior, I would inevitably find the room in a completely different area. While I can navigate through the place without too much trouble now, it's still pretty annoying when I have to find a specific room.

I sometimes wonder if I'll ever run into the people who entered this place and never left. The shifting rooms themselves aren't that difficult to understand, once you find out the patterns behind their changes. If I could work out, then surely someone else had to as well, right? I do sometimes feel as if I'm not really alone in the castle, despite being the only person who can even reach this place, not to mention the only living thing walking these halls. I haven't seen so much as a mouse since I trapped the castle within my book.

I fear that I'm also starting to develop an unhealthy attachment to this place.

有时我会想，也许我会遇到那些进入这个地方，再也没有出去的人呢？通过钻研那些房间变化的模式，理解这些移动的房间并不是那么困难。既然我能够猜透，那么肯定也有其他人能够解决，对吧？有时候我会甚至觉得，自己并不是城堡里唯一的住民。尽管一切证据都表明，我显然是唯一一个能够到达这个地方的人，乃至是在这宽敞的打听里行走的唯一生物。自从我把城堡困在我的书中以后，我连只老鼠都没见到。

You are one of several like-minded individuals that delves into knowledge long lost and forgotten, seeking sanctuary from an outside hostile world to such activities. Delving into research within the forgotten and inactive fortress of Kroshkkur, the reasons of pursuit differ among a myriad of topics. Some look to uncover knowledge hailing back to the Age of Haze when beings immensely powerful walked Eyal, while others explore the origins of themselves and other races.

Regardless of the subject or method of research, no rules exist to constrain anyone in their approach. This has led to experimentation into what many would deem mad and certainly forbidden among the surface dwellers. If Kroshkkur were to be found it would most certainly be destroyed. Therefore the only rules that truly exist in the sanctuary are that of secrecy and safeguarding the accrued knowledge that has been obtained therein.

But today the sanctuary is threatened by a giant worm that is tunneling directly towards Kroshkkur. If nothing is done it will collide with and destroy what remains of the ancient fortress. One idea to dealing with the worm is for someone to teleport inside it and make there way towards the worms brain cluster and destroy it. Alternatively, you consider leaving before the worm arrives and finding your own purpose in the outside world.

As with all things here, nothing restrains you in what path you #{bold}#ultimately choose#{normal}#. The question is whether you step into the #{bold}#portal to teleport into the worm#{normal}# or leave now while it is safe to do so and let #{bold}#Kroshkkur be destroyed#{normal}#.
